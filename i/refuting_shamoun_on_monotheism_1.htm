<P class=bodytext2 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The Quran states in many passages that Allah is the sovereign king or ruler of the universe and that the kingdom or dominion belongs entirely to him:&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P class=bodytext4 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Knowest thou not that to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and that you have none, apart from God, neither protector nor helper? S. 2:107 </FONT></P>
<P class=bodytext4 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>To Allah belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and of the earth; and Allah is powerful over everything. S. 3:189; cf. 5:17-18; 9:116</FONT></P>
<P class=bodytext2 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Specific Islamic texts emphasize the point that Allah doesn't share his rule with anyone and therefore doesn't have any associate in his kingdom: </FONT></P>
<P class=bodytext4 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>And say: 'Praise belongs to Allah, who has not taken to Him a son, <I><U>and who has not any associate in the Kingdom</U></I>, nor any protector out of humbleness.' And magnify Him with all the magnificence. S. 17:111</FONT></P>
<P class=bodytext4 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Say: "Allah knows best how long they stayed. With Him is (the knowledge of) the unseen of the heavens and the earth. How clearly He sees, and hears (everything)! They have no <I>Wali</I> (Helper, Disposer of affairs, Protector, etc.) other than Him, <I><U>and He makes NONE to share in His Decision and His Rule</U></I>." S. 18:26 Hilali-Khan</FONT></P>
<P class=bodytext4 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Blessed be He who has sent down the Salvation upon His servant, that he may be a warner to all beings; to whom belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth; and He has not taken to Him a son, <I><U>and He has no associate in the Kingdom</U></I>; and He created every thing, then He ordained it very exactly. S. 25:2</FONT></P>
<P class=bodytext2 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The Muslim scripture further mentions that on the Day of Judgment or last day Allah will show that the kingdom belongs to him alone:&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P class=bodytext4 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>It is He who created the heavens and the earth in truth; and the day He says 'Be', and it is; His saying is true, <I><U>and His is the Kingdom the day the Trumpet is blown</U></I>; He is Knower of the Unseen and the visible; He is the All-wise, the All-aware. S. 6:73</FONT></P>
<P class=bodytext4 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The Kingdom upon that day shall belong to Allah, and He shall judge between them. As for those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness, they shall be in Gardens of Bliss. S. 22:56</FONT></P>
<P class=bodytext4 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Upon the day that heaven is split asunder with the clouds and the angels are sent down in majesty, the Kingdom that day, the true Kingdom, shall belong to the All-merciful and it shall be a day harsh for the unbelievers. S. 25:25-26</FONT></P>
<P class=bodytext4 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Exalter of ranks is He, Possessor of the Throne, casting the Spirit of His bidding upon whomever He will of His servants, that he may warn them of the Day of Encounter, the day they sally forth, and naught of theirs is hidden from Allah. <I><U>'Whose is the Kingdom today?' 'It is Allah's the One, the Irresistible!</U></I>' Today each soul shall be recompensed for that it has earned; no wrong today. Surely Allah is swift at the reckoning. S. 40:15-17</FONT></P>
<P class=bodytext2 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>However, there are other passages which contradict all of this since the Quran specifically mentions individuals who share in Allah's rule and dominion:</FONT></P>
<P class=bodytext4 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Have you not considered the chiefs of the children of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region></st1:place> after Musa, when they said to a prophet of theirs: Raise up for us a king, (that) we may fight in the way of Allah. He said: May it not be that you would not fight if fighting is ordained for you? They said: And what reason have we that we should not fight in the way of Allah, and we have indeed been compelled to abandon our homes and our children. But when fighting was ordained for them, they turned back, except a few of them, and Allah knows the unjust. And their prophet said to them: Surely Allah has raised Talut to be a king over you. They said: How can he hold kingship over us while we have a greater right to kingship than he, and he has not been granted an abundance of wealth? He said: Surely Allah has chosen him in preference to you, and He has increased him abundantly in knowledge and physique, <I><U>and Allah grants His kingdom to whom He pleases</U></I>, and Allah is Ample giving, Knowing. And the prophet said to them: Surely the sign <I><U>of His kingdom</U></I> is, that there shall come to you the chest in which there is tranquility from your Lord and residue of the relics of what the children of Moses and the children of Aaron have left, the angels bearing it; most surely there is a sign in this for those who believe. And David slew Jalut, <I><U>and Allah gave him kingdom</U></I> and wisdom, and taught him of what He pleased. And were it not for Allah's repelling some men with others, the earth would certainly be in a state of disorder; but Allah is Gracious to the creatures. S. 2:246-248, 251</FONT></P>
<P class=bodytext4 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Say: 'O Allah, Master of the Kingdom, <I><U>Thou givest the Kingdom to whom Thou wilt</U></I>, and seizest the Kingdom from whom Thou wilt, Thou exaltest whom Thou wilt, and Thou abasest whom Thou wilt; in Thy hand is the good; Thou art powerful over everything. S. 3:26</FONT></P>
<P class=bodytext4 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>And when Moses said to his people, 'O my people, remember Allah's blessing upon you, when He appointed among you Prophets, <I><U>and appointed you kings</U></I>, and gave you such as He had not given to any being. S. 5:20 </FONT></P>
<P class=bodytext4 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Certainly We tried Solomon, and We cast upon <I><U>his throne</U></I> a mere body; then he repented. He said, 'My Lord, forgive me, <I><U>and give me a kingdom such as may not befall anyone after me</U></I>; surely Thou art the All-giver.' So We subjected to him the wind, that ran at his commandment, softly, wherever he might light on, and the Satans, every builder and diver and others also, coupled in fetters: This is Our gift; bestow or withhold without reckoning.' And he had a near place in Our presence and a fair resort. S. 38:34-40</FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>It has never crossed Shamoun's mind that the first verses that he put forth mean that no one <B>ULTIMATELY </B>owns the kingdoms of the world just as Allah, however if Allah wills He may allow a human being to rule over the people and have a kingdom of his own. Notice that Surah 3:26 that Shamoun put forth for us makes it clear that it is Allah who can give the kingdom to whomever He wills, which indicates that He is the <B>ultimate </B>one in control. </FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Hence, even if Allah does allow kings to rule over their kingdoms, it doesn't change the fact that there is still only one true ruler over all the kingdoms of the world and that is Allah, since it is only by His will that kings could rule over others.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Also, can't we pose the same argument against Shamoun?

<P class=bodytext2 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>To make matters worse, there are certain expositors which say that the following passage,</FONT></P>
<P class=bodytext4 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>And as for the night, keep vigil a part of it, as a work of supererogation for thee; it <B><I>MAY BE</I></B> that thy Lord will raise thee up to a laudable station. S. 17:79</FONT></P>
<P class=bodytext2 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Refers to the last day when Allah will actually seat Muhammad on his very own throne! The renowned Muslim historian and commentator al-Tabari wrote that:</FONT></P>
<P class=bodytext4 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>"Even though the traditions we have mentioned on the authority of the Prophet and his Companions and the Followers indicate the correct interpretation of <I>maqaman mahmudan </I>in Qur. 17:79 (as referring to Muhammad's role as intercessor on the Day of Resurrection), <U>Mujahid's statement that God will seat Muhammad on His Throne remains one whose soundness CANNOT BE REJECTED either on the basis of traditions (<I>khabar</I>) or on the basis of speculation (<I>nazar</I>)</U>. This is so because there is no tradition from the Messenger of God or anyone of his Companions or the Followers that declares it to be impossible. <U>From what we have said, it has become clear that, it is not impossible for an adherent of Islam to say what Mujahid had said, namely, that God will seat Muhammad on His Throne</U>. If someone says: We do not disapprove of God's seating Muhammad on His Throne (in view of the following tradition transmitted by) 'Abbas b. 'Abd al-'Azim - Yahya b. Kathir - al-Jurayri - Sayf al-Sadusi - 'Abdallah b. Salam: 'On the Day of Resurrection, Muhammad will be on the Lord's footstool (<I>kursi</I>),' but we disapprove of God's seating him <I>together with Him</I>, it should be said: Is it then permissible in your opinion that He seat him on it but not together with him? If he permits this, he is led to affirming that either he is together with Him, or God seats him (on the Throne) while being Himself either separate from it or neither contiguous with nor separate from it. Whatever alternative he chooses, he thereby enters into something that he disapproves. If he says that it is not permissible, he deviates from the statements of all the groups we have reported. This means diverging from the views of all adherents of Islam, since there is no other possible statement than those three, <U>according to each of which Mujahid's statement in this sense is not impossible</U>."

<P class=bodytext2 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Al-Qurtubi, who is also viewed as an outstanding Muslim exegete, commented on this same Quranic reference in his <I>al-Jami' li Ahkam al-Qur'an</I>:</FONT></P>
<P class=bodytext4 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The third explanation of this verse <U>is what al-Tabari reported from a party of scholars - among them Mujahid</U> - whereby "the Exalted Station <U>is the seating by Allah of the Prophet with Him on His Throne <I>(kursiyyih)</I></U>." They narrated a hadith to that effect, and al-Tabari backed up the possibility <I>(jawâz)</I> of such a thing with some extravagant statements <I>(shatatin min al-qawl)</I>. However, what he said cannot be inferred [from the verse] except with over-subtlety as to meaning <I>(al-talattuf bi al-ma'nâ)</I>, and it is far-fetched <I>(fîhi bu'd)</I>. This is not to say that there is no such narration; only that [one endowed with] knowledge interprets it figuratively <I>(al-'ilmu yata'awwaluhu)</I>. On that basis it is the same, with respect to possibility, whether Allah seats the Prophet on the Throne or on the ground. For His elevation over the Throne is not in the sense of displacement <I>(intiqâl)</I>, removal <I>(zawâl)</I>, nor change of position from standing to sitting, nor any state or condition to which the Throne itself is subject. Rather, He is elevated over the Throne in the way He has stated concerning Himself, without saying how. Nor does His seating of the Prophet on the Throne impose upon the Prophet (s) the attribute of Lordship [<I>sic</I>] or move him out of that of servanthood [<I>sic</I>]. Rather, it consists in an elevation because of his status, and an honor bestowed upon him because of his sublime character.

<P class=bodytext2 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Another Muslim authority named Ibn Batta stated in his book <I>al-Sharh wa al-Ibana 'ala Usul al-Sunna wa al-Diyana</I> ("Elaboration of the Principles of Sunni Doctrine"), p. 61, that:</FONT></P>
<P class=bodytext4 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman"><U>The Prophet shall be seated on the Throne with his Lord</U> <I>(yujlas ma'a rabbihi 'alâ al-'arsh)</I>, and this privilege belongs to no one else. Thus did Nafi' narrate it from Ibn 'Umar<U> </U>from the Prophet concerning the verse: "It may be that thy Lord will raise you to an Exalted Station" - <U>he said that He shall seat him with Him on the Throne</U>. Thus also did Mujahid explain it, as narrated by Muhammad ibn Fudayl, from al-Layth, from Mujahid. (Underline emphasis ours) </FONT></FONT></P>
<P class=bodytext2 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>In case the readers are wondering who this Mujahid is, he is Mujahid ibn Jabr, Abu al-Hajjaj al-Makhzumi (d. 102), one of the major commen&shy;tators of the Qur'an among the <I>tabi'in</I> or followers of Muhammad's companions (<I>sahabah</I>), and viewed as holding the highest rank in reli&shy;ability among hadith narrators (<I>thiqa</I>). It is related by a Muslim scholar named Ibn Sa'd, in <I>al-Tabaqat</I> <I>al-Kubra </I>(6:9), that Mujahid went over the explanation of the Islamic scripture together with Ibn 'Abbas, Muhammad's first cousin and one of the most knowledgeable Muslims that ever lived, approximately thirty times. </FONT></P>
<P class=bodytext2 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>And here is a modern Muslim writer who affirms this interpretation:</FONT></P>
<P class=bodytext4 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Do they know any other Prophet or angel whom Allah addressed directly and by whose life He swore? "By thy life (O Muhammad)!" (15:72); "And who is better in his discourse than he who calls unto Allah and does good and says: I am one of the Muslims?" (41:33) i.e. who is better in speech than the Prophet? "Lo! those who believe and do good works are the best of created beings" (98:7) i.e. the Prophet is the best of created beings; "Lo! the noblest of you, in the sight of Allah, is the best in conduct" (49:13) i.e. the Prophet is the noblest of those to whom the Qur'an is addressed in the sight of Allah; "And lo! thou (Muhammad) art [I swear] of a tremendous nature" (68:4). The reality of this compliment - khuluqin `azim - can be fathomed only by the Speaker Himself and whoever He wills; "Of those messengers, some of whom We have caused to excel others, and of whom there are some unto whom Allah spake, while _some of them He exalted (above others) in degree_" (2:253) i.e. the Prophet. "<I>And we preferred some of the Prophets above others</I>" (17:55) then He said: "<I>It may be that thy Lord will raise thee to a praised estate</I>" (17:79), a Station which the Prophet said none but he would receive and this is the Station of Intercession <U>at the right of the Glorious Throne</U> as we described at length in the posting "The Seating of the Prophet on the Throne."

<P class=bodytext2 style="MARGIN: auto 0in" align=justify><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>And even if a Muslim rejects these narratives s/he must still contend with the gross contradiction within the Islamic scripture concerning the question of whether Allah shares his rule or not.

<P class=bodytext2 style="MARGIN: auto 0in" align=justify><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The problem with this explanation is that this is not the plain reading of the passages and that is not what the verses say. Since Muslims believe that the Quran is the standard of Arabic eloquence and grammar we would expect to find the Muslim scripture being more clear in communicating this point regarding Allah granting dominion to his creatures since the kingdom belongs to him, assuming of course that this is what the author(s) of the Quran was(were) actually saying. In other words, one can only accept this interpretation, e.g. Allah wasn't denying that there are others who reign but was really saying that all rulership stems from him, at the expense of the Quran's alleged perfect eloquence and structure. A Muslim must face the fact that the author(s) of the Quran once again failed to clearly communicate his/her/their message since s/he/they didn't write what s/he/they really wanted to say, but wrote in such a way as to convey the wrong idea which actually ended up contradicting other verses of the Quran!&nbsp; </FONT></P>

He cites the scholars condemning people as Jahmis and heretics if they denied that Muhammad (peace be upon him) sits on the Throne. But there is a huge difference between the Jahmis and others such as my self who would reject this belief. The reason why the Jahmis rejected this belief is because of logical and philosophical reasons. They objected to its possibility. This is worthy of condemnation. However, I would reject the belief because there is no solid evidence for it in Qur'an or authentic hadeeth. I wouldn't be condemned for that.
