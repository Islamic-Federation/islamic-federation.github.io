<font size="3"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: times new roman">Prophet's Marriage to Aisha is becoming a famous topic amongst the critics of Islam. Whilst discussing this, they completely ignore the traditions at the time and the fruits the blessed marriage brought. In this article we will be exploring the reasons behind the marriage as well as affirming that Prophet Muhammed was not a paedophile. First of all let's examine the proof from Islamic sources regarding marriage to Aisha (RA):</span><br />

<font size="3"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: times new roman">From the hadith it is confirmed that engagement was done when Aisha (RA) was 6 and then marriage was consummated when she was 9 years old. It must be noted that the marriage was extremely successful as it is evident from countless hadiths. Indeed, from a Muslim's perspective the marriage was divine:</span></font></div>

</font><font size="3"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: times new roman">Morality is relative not absolute, it varies from culture to culture and society to society. What is perceived to be moral in USA may not hold to be true in other parts of the world, such as Africa and Asia. Morality is also relative to time, fornication/dating little time ago was regarded as taboo and a matter of shame for the family. However, now this is a common habit, dating could start as early as at the age of 10. Another example would be dress code, which was very modest in history but not so now.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="FONT-FAMILY: times new roman">Therefore, we need to analyse the age of marriage in history and judge Prophet's marriage from there. Historically, the age at which a girl was considered ready to be married was puberty; this also was the case in biblical times. In an article called &quot;</span></font><a style="FONT-FAMILY: times new roman" href="http://www.theology.edu/marriage.htm"><font color="#6699cc" size="3">Ancient Israelite Marriage Customs</font></a><font size="3"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: times new roman">&quot;, by Jim West, ThD - a Baptist minister writes:</span><br />
<br />
<em style="FONT-FAMILY: times new roman"><span style="COLOR: rgb(153,102,51)">&quot;The wife was to be taken from within the larger family circle (<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">usually at the outset of puberty</span> or around the age of 13) in order to maintain the purity of the family line;&quot;</span> </em><br />
<br />
<span style="FONT-FAMILY: times new roman">While discussing the meaning of the word 'almah, which is the Hebrew word for &quot;young woman&quot; or &quot;adolescent female&quot;, Gerald Segal, in his book &quot;The Jew and the Christian Missionary&quot;, Ktav Publishing House,1981, page 28 says:</span><br />
<br />
</font><span style="FONT-SIZE: 100%; COLOR: rgb(153,102,51); FONT-FAMILY: times new roman"><em><font size="3">&quot;It should be noted, however, that in biblical times <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">females married at an early age</span>.&quot; </font></em></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 100%"><br />

<div class="post-body"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 100%; COLOR: rgb(153,102,51); FONT-FAMILY: times new roman"><em><font size="3">&quot;American reformers were shocked to discover that the laws of most states set the <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">age of consent at the age of ten or twelve, and in one state, Delaware, the age of consent was only seven</span>.&quot; </font></em></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 100%"><br />
<br />
<font size="3"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: times new roman">Thus it was a norm to be married at a young age. This is why the people of Quraish and other Arabian tribes at Prophet's time found absolutely no fault in their marriage. On the contrary it is evident from countless narrations that the marriage was successful. They detested Islam, they did everything to belittle the Prophet, tried to prevent Islam from spreading and even attempted to kill the Prophet! However, they raised no objection to the marriage of the Prophet to Aisha since at those times such a thing was not considered 'immoral'.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="FONT-FAMILY: times new roman">Nabia Abbott, who is a western female orientalist and has written many anti-islam materials, writes in her book Aishah-The Beloved of Mohammed, Al-Saqi Books, London, 1985, page 7:</span><br />
<br />
</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><em face="times new roman"><span style="COLOR: rgb(153,102,51)">&quot;It is not clear just when the marriage actually took place. According to some versions, it was in the month of Shawwal of the Year 1, that is, some seven or eight months after the arrival at Medina; but, according to others, it was not until after the Battle of Badr, that is, in Shawwal of the second year of the Hijrah. <strong>In no version is there any comment made on the disparity of the ages between Mohammed and Aishah or on the tender age of the bride who, at the most, could not have been over ten years</strong> old and who was still much enamoured with her play.&quot; </span></em><br />
<br />
<span style="FONT-FAMILY: times new roman">Even in our times in certain parts of the world the age of marriage is still relatively low. According to a chart on (</span></font></font><a style="FONT-FAMILY: times new roman" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_consent#Ages_of_consent_in_various_countries"><font color="#6699cc" size="3">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_consent#Ages_of_consent_in_various_countries</font></a><font size="3"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: times new roman"> ) the age of consent in Mexico and Philippines is only 12. In Guyana, Japan, South Korea, Spain and Swaziland the age of consent is 13. Hence even in ?Today's Times' a young marriage is not abnormal, as some in the west think.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="FONT-FAMILY: times new roman">Should the people of United Kingdom, where the age limit is higher, be correct in slandering the people of Philippines/Mexico where the age limit is much lower and thus married at young age? Of course not! Or if within few centuries the age of marriage rises up to 20, then should those people have a right to slander those who lived at our times and married before 20? By the same token, we should not criticize the marriage of the Prophet based on the norm of our time.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="FONT-FAMILY: times new roman">It ought also be noted that Aisha ( RA) was engaged to Jubayr son of Mut'im before Prophet Muhammed. This indicates the age of marriage and engagement in Prophet's time. However, the engagement was later nullified by Jubayr's parents due to Abu Bakr (RA) embracing Islam. This can be read in detail on </span></font><a style="FONT-FAMILY: times new roman" href="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/companion/02_abu_bakr.htm#Holy%20Prophet"><font color="#6699cc" size="3">http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/companion/02_abu_bakr.htm#Holy%20Prophet</font></a><br />
<br />
<font size="3"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: times new roman">Thus the history demonstrates that the age of the marriage was lower and relative to olden times, the marriage of the Prophet was not abnormal and there was nothing immoral about it. It was a norm at biblical times to be wedded at puberty or earlier, the age of consent one century ago in a 'modern country' was as low as 10 or 12, even 7 in Delaware! Even in our times, in certain societies, the age of consent is as low as 12 or 13. In the light of historical evidences, the marriage cannot be criticized.</span><br />

<p style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: rgb(153,102,51)"><em>&quot;Never had we (the companions) had any difficulty for the solution of which we approached Aisha and did not get some useful information from her&quot;. -- Sirat-I-Aisha, on the authority of Trimidhi, p. 163</em></span>. </font></p>
<p style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)"><font size="3">Thus the contribution of Aisha was vital, without her perhaps much of the sunnah would have been lost. In addition the marriage also refuted the notion that a man could not marry the daughter of a man who he had declared to be his &quot;brother&quot; (even in the religious sense). Since the Prophet and Abu Bakr had declared each other to be &quot;brothers&quot;, this notion was done away with. This is demonstrated in the following hadith: </font></p>

<span style="COLOR: rgb(102,102,0)"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: rgb(153,102,51)"><em>&quot;Narrated 'Ursa:<br />
The Prophet asked Abu Bakr for 'Aisha's hand in marriage. Abu Bakr said &quot;But I am your brother.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;You are my brother in Allah's religion and His Book, but she (Aisha) is lawful for me to marry.&quot;&quot; (Sahih Bukhari, Volume 7, Book 62, Number 18)</em></span> </font></span></p>
<p><br />
<span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)"><font size="3">This is another teaching, which the marriage portrayed. The marriage also strengthened the relationship between Abu Bakr and Prophet Muhammed. Let us bear in mind that Abu Bakr was the first Caliph. </font></span></p>

<p style="COLOR: rgb(153,102,51); FONT-STYLE: italic"><font size="3">&quot;Pedophile: also spelled PAEDOPHILIA, psychosexual disorder in which an adult's arousal and sexual gratification occur primarily through sexual contact with prepubescent children. The typical paedophile is <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">unable to find satisfaction in an adult sexual relationship</span> and may have <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">low self-esteem</span>, seeing <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">sexual activity with a child as less threatening</span> than that with an adult.&quot; Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1998.</font></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)"><font size="3">Apart from Aisha, all his wives were <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">more than 16 </span>(The Prophet of Islam, the Ideal Husband (Lahore: Kazi Publications), pp. 10-12), which at those times was considered as a mature age. Indeed, his first wife was twice widowed before and was older than him by 15 years. All his wives except Aisha and Marya were widows. Therefore, it is evident that Prophet's marriage with Aisha was not a norm and Prophet did indeed find adult relationship. Prophet also did not have low self-esteem, as it is evident from his Seerah.<br />

<p><span style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,0)"><font size="3">It is commonly accepted by Muslims and non-muslims (un-biased) that Prophet in no sense indulged in &quot;exhibitionism, voyeurism, or rape&quot; or even came close to it. There is not a single reference to indicate that prophet was involved in any such act. In addition, Prophet waited for Aisha to mature and reach Puberty before the marriage was consummated, this obviously is contrary to the characteristics of a paedophile.<br />
