Atheism and Society (1997) A discussion of the position of atheism within today's society--including how it affects people's day-to-day relationships. Particularly recommended if you're an atheist or agnostic. Is Atheism Presumptuous? A Reply to Paul Copan (2000) Lowder refutes Paul Copan's claim that Antony Flew's \"presumption of atheism\" is itself presumptuous. In Defense of an Evidential Argument from Evil: A Reply to William Lane Craig (2016) In a popular article about general arguments from evil against the existence of an all-powerful, all-knowing, and perfectly good God, William Lane Craig raises objections to such arguments that are consistent with those he earlier raised against Paul Draper's evidential pain-and-pleasure argument from evil in an oral debate with Draper in 1998. In this article Jeffrey Jay Lowder considers whether Craig's points have any force in rebutting Draper's writings on his pain-and-pleasure argument, ultimately concluding that they leave Draper's argument unscathed. Is a Proof of the Nonexistence of a God Even Possible? (1998) A common objection to atheism--one stated by many scholars and laymen, theists and nontheists--is that it is impossible to prove the nonexistence of God. Yet there are actually two ways to prove the nonexistence of something. One way is to prove that it cannot exist because its very concept is self-contradictory (e.g., square circles, married bachelors, etc.). The other way is by carefully looking and seeing. Both of these methods can and have been used to disprove various conceptions of God. The Empirical Case for Metaphysical Naturalism (1999) Lowder argues that the physical dependence of minds upon the brain, along with the argument from evil, can be used to construct an empirical case for metaphysical naturalism. David Noebel on Atheism and Biological Evolution (2000) A critical notice of David Noebel's book, Understanding the Times. I assess in detail Noebel's objections to atheism and biological evolution. Along the way I discuss such diverse topics as the argument from reasonable nonbelief, cosmic vs. personal meaning, methodological naturalism, abiogenesis and the origin of life, whether natural selection is a tautology, beneficial mutations, the fossil record, and punctuated equilibrium. Summary and Assessment of the Craig-Jesseph Debate (1998) A summary and assessment of the 1997 debate on the existence of God between William Lane Craig and Doug Jesseph. Lowder concludes that the overall debate was a draw (in terms of quality of argument), but that Craig won as far as the effectiveness of presentation was concerned. Summary of the Kurtz-Craig Debate (2001) A summary of the 2001 debate between Paul Kurtz and William Lane Craig on ethics without God. Christianity: Historical Criticism and Counter-Apologetics NOTE: Includes critiques of both Christian apologists (Josh McDowell and William Lane Craig) and critics of Christianity (Dennis McKinsey and William Edelen). Empty Defense of an Empty Tomb: A Reply to Anne A. Kim's Misunderstandings (2012) William Lane Craig has argued for the historicity of Jesus' empty tomb on the basis of ten lines of evidence. In response, Jeffery Jay Lowder argued that Craig had not yet shown that any of his ten items of evidence make the empty tomb more probable than not. Anne A. Kim has attempted to defend some of Craig's arguments against Lowder's objections, but as Lowder shows in this response to Kim, Kim has repeatedly misunderstood his points and attacked caricatures of his arguments rather than his actual arguments. Historical Evidence and the Empty Tomb Story: A Reply to William Lane Craig (2001) Lowder provides a point-by-point rebuttal to Craig's case for the empty tomb. Along the way, Lowder defends a naturalistic explanation of the empty tomb. He concludes that historians should be agnostic about the empty tomb story. Was the Burial of Jesus a Temporary One, Because of Time Constraints? (2002) by Glenn Miller (Off Site) Miller rebuts the hypothesis that Jesus' body was only temporarily stored in Joseph of Arimathea's tomb. Reply to Glenn Miller on the Burial of Jesus (2002) by Richard Carrier Carrier concludes that, despite Miller's objections, the relocation hypothesis is still a plausible one. The Historicity of Jesus' Resurrection (1995) [ Index ] A critical assessment of the arguments used by Christians and skeptics about the resurrection of Jesus. How Not to Refute Biblical Infallibility: A Reply to William Edelen (2000) Lowder responds to a recent attack on Biblical infallibility by William Edelen, arguing that every one of Edelen's objections are fallacious. How Not to Refute the Historicity and Resurrection of Jesus: A Critique of Dennis McKinsey's Encyclopedia of Biblical Errancy (2001) \"Although McKinsey occasionally raises some good points concerning the Resurrection and the extrabiblical references to Jesus, they are often hidden within many more objections that are either irrelevant, fallacious, or both. Moreover, there are many important issues related to the historicity of Jesus and the Resurrection, which McKinsey ignores. ... Given these shortcomings in the sections on the historicity and resurrection of Jesus, I can't help but wonder what deficiencies exist in the rest of McKinsey's Encyclopedia. I do not recommend skeptics rely on McKinsey's scholarship without first independently verifying his claims in a reliable source.\" Independent Confirmation and the Historicity of Jesus (1997) Lowder argues that there is nothing intrinsically improbable about the mere existence of a man named Jesus; the New Testament alone should constitute prima facie evidence for the historicity of Jesus. The Jury Is In: The Ruling on McDowell's &quot;Evidence&quot; (editor) [ Index ] A comprehensive rebuttal to Josh McDowell's Evidence That Demands a Verdict, which many Christians mysteriously hail as a masterpiece of Christian apologetics. McDowell refuses to link to this critique. Featured Editorials Anti-Atheist Media Bias? (1998) Many political and religious conservatives complain that American media is \"liberal,\" \"secular,\" or even \"anti-Christian.\" But is this really true? Was the recent Wall Street Journal attack on the Campus Freethought Alliance just an anomaly? Or is the American media biased in favor of theism? Government-Sanctioned National Day of Prayer? (1998) On May 7, 1998, more than a million Americans reportedly observed the 47th annual National Day of Prayer. The theme was, \"America, Return to God,\" and was based on Joel 2:12-13. In other words, we must repent of our sins and submit our lives to God. But what are the legal implications of government sponsorship of this religious observance? The God of Terrorism (1998) Pat Robertson recently predicted that Florida would get hit by a hurricane because it hosted \"Gay Days.\" But what sort of God does Robertson belive in? In Defense of the Original, Secular Pledge of Allegiance (2002) Lowder defends the original, secular Pledge of Allegiance. He argues that inserting the words \"under God\" into the Pledge of Allegiance was an unconstitutional establishment of religion. &lt;!-- ## Keep this in case Lowder should decide to write a response ## A Response to Jeffery Jay Lowder's \"In Defense of the Original, Secular Pledge of Allegiance\" (2003) by Donn Day (Off Site) Day argues that \"under God\" is not an establishment of religion. Moreover, the First Amendment does not stop the government from endorsing belief over nonbelief. --&gt; Is 'Freethinker' Synonymous with Nontheist? (2001) Quoting Bertrand Russell, Lowder argues that theists can be freethinkers and that not all nontheists are freethinkers. 'Secular' Does Not Mean 'Atheistic' (2000) Debate is raging through the country over the recent Supreme Court decision not to allowstudent-led prayer on the football field. Lowder challenges the opposition by clarifying the difference between a secular government and an atheistic one, thereby showing the fallacies of the arguments being raised. The Pledge of Allegiance, the Courts, and Death Threats (2002) Lowder discusses the recent public backlash against the Pledge of Allegiance decision, including death threats against the Plaintiff. Reviews Can Man Live Without God? by Ravi Zacharias (1999) New Evidence That Demands a Verdict by Josh McDowell (2001) The Case for Christ by Lee Strobel (Updated: June 4, 2002) Free Advertising Isn't the Point (2000) Lowder responds to a recent Hanegraaff \"Bible Answer Man\" radio show segment with The Case for Christ author Lee Strobel. After a caller mentioned Lowder's book review on the Internet and asked Strobel to respond, he and Hanegraaff went to great lengths to avoid talking about it or mentioning \"Lowder\" or the \"Secular Web\" by name, claiming that it would be \"free advertising\" to do so. Why are these gentlemen afraid of us? What are they trying to hide from their listeners? Atheism, Morality, and Meaning by Michael Martin (2003) On Two Reviews of Atheism, Morality and Meaning by Michael Martin (2003) Michael Martin responds to reviews by Taner Edis and Jeffery Jay Lowder of his book Atheism, Morality and Meaning, answering Lowder's specific criticisms which, according to Martin, are based at least in part on \"serious misunderstandings.\" Reply to Martin on Atheism and Morality (2003) Lowder responds to Martin's recent reply to his review of Martin's book, Atheism, Morality and Meaning, answering Martin's objections. See Also A Fond Farewell to Jeffery Jay Lowder (2000) by James Still On January 15, after five years of building the Secular Web from the ground up, Internet Infidels President Jeffery Jay Lowder will retire. Jeff has decided it is time to move on and is interested in going back to school to study philosophy. He also looks forward to finishing several papers and other projects. Internet Infidels: A Decade of Internet Infidels (MP3) (2005) InfidelGuy (Reginald Finley) discusses the 10 Year Anniversary of the Secular Web with Internet Infidels founder Jeffery J. Lowder (Real Audio), Executive Director Keith Augustine, and Publicity Director Clark Adams. Topics discussed include the history, purpose, and current projects of Internet Infidels, the usefulness of religious debates, the online community fostered by the Internet Infidels Discussion Forum, and the future of the Secular Web. Questions and comments from callers are included. The Lowder-Fernandes Debate: Naturalism vs. Theism: Which Way Does the Evidence Point? (1999) Order your copy of the videotape of this debate today! T.J. Walker's Radio Interview of Lowder (July 12, 1999) (Off Site) (16 minutes Real Audio file) NOTE: You will need a Real Audio player to listen to this interview. To download a Real Audio player on your system, please go to http://www.real.com T.J. Walker talks to Lowder about the history and purpose of Internet Infidels, Inc.; the meanings of terms 'atheism' and 'agnosticism'; Pat Robertson; whether we should ignore the Radical Religious Right; Margaret Downey's battle against discrimination by the Boy Scouts of America; whether having \"In God We Trust\" printed on all U.S. currency really matters; what the Secular Web has to offer; how the Internet offers freethinkers a level playing field in the marketplace of ideas; the fact that nontheists are the last minority in the USA which it is politically correct to hate; how freethinkers can support the Secular Web. Jeffery Jay Lowder is the co-founder and past President of Internet Infidels, Inc., an international coalition of non-theists dedicated to promoting and defending a naturalistic worldview on the Internet.","url":"https://infidels.org/author/jeffery-jay-lowder/"}]}</script>

<p><i>This review was originally published in <u>Philo</u> 2 (1999), pp. 89-102. <b>Note: A <a href="/library/modern/jeff-lowder-strobel-rev/">revised version</a> of this review is available.</b></i></p>



<p><b>Review of Lee Strobel <u>The Case for Christ: A Journalist&#8217;s Personal Investigation of the Evidence for Jesus</u> Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 1998.</b></p>



<p>Lee Strobel, an ex-investigative reporter for the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> who describes himself as a &#8220;former spiritual skeptic,&#8221; is a teaching pastor at Willow Creek Community Church. (Willow Creek is a mega-church with more than 30,000 members and was the site of a very high profile debate&#8211;moderated by Strobel&#8211;on &#8220;Atheism vs. Christianity: Where Does the Evidence Point?&#8221; between William Lane Craig and Frank Zindler.[<a href="#1">1</a>]) Using his skills as a former legal affairs journalist, Strobel set out to &#8220;retrace and expand upon the spiritual journey &#8230; [he] took for nearly two years.&#8221; <i>The Case for Christ</i> is a summary of Strobel&#8217;s interviews with thirteen leading Evangelical apologists, including Craig Blomberg, Bruze Metzger, Edwin Yamauchi, Ben Witherington III, and William Lane Craig.</p>



<p>In light of Strobel&#8217;s frequent reminders that he used to be a hard-nosed, skeptical journalist, I skimmed the table of contents and index to see which critics of Christianity he interviewed. In so doing, I discovered a glaring deficiency in Strobel&#8217;s journalism: Strobel did not interview <i>any</i> critics of Christian apologetics, even though he attacks such individuals in his book.[<a href="#2">2</a>] For example, Strobel devotes an entire chapter to his interview of Greg Boyd (an outspoken faultfinder of the Jesus Seminar), yet Strobel never interviewed a <i>single member</i> of the Jesus Seminar itself! Likewise, he repeatedly criticizes Michael Martin, author of <i>Case Against Christianity</i>, but he never bothered to get Martin&#8217;s responses to those attacks.[<a href="#3">3</a>] This hardly constitutes balanced reporting on Strobel&#8217;s part; indeed, on this basis, one is tempted to dismiss the entire book.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, I was compelled to review <i>The Case for Christ</i>, for two reasons. First, it comes with a number of endorsements from high-profile Evangelicals:</p>



<ul><li>Bruce Metzger, Professor of New Testament, Emeritus, Princeton Theological Seminary;</li><li>Phillip Johnson, Law Professor, University of California at Berkeley;</li><li>Ravi Zacharias, Ravi Zacharias International Ministries;</li><li>D. James Kennedy, Coral Ridge Ministries;</li><li>J.P. Moreland, Professor of Philosophy, Talbott School of Theology, Biola University; and</li><li>Peter Kreeft, Professor of Philosophy, Boston College.</li></ul>



<p>Second, Strobel interviewed a number of high-caliber Evangelical apologists, many of whom are worthy of consideration in and of themselves. Thus <i>The Case for Christ</i> constitutes a pseudo-anthology of Evangelical scholarship.</p>



<p>For these two reasons, I think <i>The Case for Christ</i> deserves critical notice despite its utter failure to honestly engage contemporary critics of (Evangelical) Christian apologetics. Therefore, I want to comment briefly on the book&#8217;s three main parts.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Part 1: &#8220;Examining the Record&#8221;</h3>



<p>In the first part of <i>The Case for Christ</i>, Strobel defends the historical reliability of the New Testament. He considers five lines of evidence: (a) the eyewitness evidence, (b) documentary evidence, (c) corroborating evidence, (d) scientific evidence, and (e) rebuttal evidence.</p>



<p>(a) <b><u><a id="eyewitness" name="eyewitness"></a>Eyewitness Evidence</u></b>: Strobel dedicates two chapters to summarize his interview of Craig Blomberg concerning the four gospels. Blomberg acknowledges that &#8220;strictly speaking, the gospels are anonymous&#8221; (p. 26). Nonetheless, Blomberg suggests that the four gospels were in fact written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John and therefore the canonical gospels are eyewitness testimony. According to Blomberg, this fact is confirmed by Papias (writing <i>circa</i> CE 125) and Irenaeus (writing <i>circa</i> 180); the authorship of the gospels was never in doubt among early Christians. And Blomberg dismisses the Q hypothesis as &#8220;nothing more than a hypothesis&#8221; (p. 31). Yet the two-source hypothesis&#8211;that Matthew and Luke were written with a copy of Mark and Q in front of them&#8211;is not just an arbitrary assumption held only by liberal scholars. The evidence has led even conservative scholars to accept the existence of Q. Daniel Wallace of Dallas Theological Seminary has written an excellent paper, &#8220;The Synoptic Problem,&#8221; which argues for both Markan priority and the existence of Q.[<a href="#4">4</a>] Yet if the two-source hypothesis is correct, Matthew and Luke are based heavily on Mark; it is therefore unlikely that Matthew and Luke constitute <i>independent</i> accounts. Moreover, the traditional authorship of Mark is open to serious question.[<a href="#5">5</a>] Finally, it is unlikely that John was authored by John, son of Zebedee, for it seems to have been heavily edited and reworked.</p>



<p>Blomberg also repeats the familiar apologetic assertion that, if the claims of Evangelical Christianity were false, hostile witnesses would have happily shouted that fact from the mountaintops. He says, &#8220;If critics could have attacked it on the basis that it was full of falsehoods or distortions, they would have&#8221; (p. 66). Yet Edwin Yamauchi gives the decisive objection to this fallacious argument from silence just 48 pages later in the book! As Yamauchi points out, &#8220;When people begin religious movements, it&#8217;s often not until many generations later that people record things about them&#8221; (p. 114). This was certainly the case with early Christianity. Robert L. Wilken, a Christian historian, notes, &#8220;For almost a century Christianity went unnoticed by most men and women in the Roman Empire. &#8230; [Non-Christians] saw the Christian community as a tiny, peculiar, antisocial, irreligious sect, drawing its adherents from the lower strata of society.&#8221;[<a href="#6">6</a>] First-century non-Christians had about as much interest in refuting Christian claims as twentieth century skeptics had in refuting the misguided claims of the Heaven&#8217;s Gate cult: they simply didn&#8217;t care to refute it.</p>



<p>Even conservative authors admit that the books of the New Testament originally existed only as oral tradition. But if that is the case, Strobel asks, &#8220;How can we be sure that the material about Jesus&#8217; life and teachings was well preserved for thirty years before it was finally written down in the gospels?&#8221; (p. 53). According to Blomberg, the disciples lived in an &#8220;oral culture, in which there was great emphasis placed on memorization&#8221; (p. 53). Yet recent psychological studies have shown that human memory is often incredibly unreliable, especially when it is memory of an unusual event.[<a href="#7">7</a>] <i>The upshot is that the oral traditions about Jesus were probably not historically accurate.</i> This objection was emphasized by John Dominic Crossan, a former co-chair of the Jesus Seminar, in his recent book <i>The Birth of Christianity</i>,[<a href="#8">8</a>] but so far as I can tell Strobel never addresses this crucial point.</p>



<p>(b) <b><u><a id="documentary" name="documentary"></a>Documentary Evidence</u></b>: Strobel next writes about his interview of Bruce Metzger on the reliability of the <i>textual</i> transmission of the New Testament. In other words, since the original books of the New Testament are lost, how do we know that &#8220;each copied document was identical to the original memo?&#8221; According to Metzger, &#8220;the more often you have copies that agree with each other, especially if they emerge from different geographical areas, the more you can cross-check them to figure out what the original document was like&#8221; (p. 76). Moreover, as Metzger points out, we have far more ancient copies of the New Testament than we have of, say, Homer&#8217;s <i>Iliad</i> or Tacitus&#8217;s <i>Annals of Imperial Rome</i>. Since I am not aware of any classical scholar who seriously questions the textual reliability of <i>those</i> works, I am willing to accept the <i>textual</i> reliability of the New Testament.[<a href="#9">9</a>]</p>



<p>Strobel also asked Metzger why some books were included in the New Testament and others (e.g., the Gospel of Thomas) were not. As Strobel puts it, &#8220;What about allegations that church councils squelched equally legitimate documents because they didn&#8217;t like the picture of Jesus they portrayed?&#8221; (p. 85). Metzger&#8217;s answer was that &#8220;the New Testament contains the best sources for the historicity of Jesus&#8221; (p. 87). He stated that the early church adopted three criteria in evaluating documents for inclusion in the New Testament:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>(i) Was the book written by an apostle or by a follower of an apostle?<br><br>(ii) Did the book conform with what Christians already believed?<br><br>(iii) Had the book been continuously accepted and used by the church at large? (p. 86)</p></blockquote>



<p>In other words, Metzger <i>admits</i> that &#8220;church councils squelched equally legitimate documents because they didn&#8217;t like the picture of Jesus they portrayed!&#8221; After all, consider the implications of these three criteria: (i) excludes <i>a priori</i> the testimony of non-Christian historians; (ii) rules out the possibility of books that did not conform to what Christians already believed; and (iii) ensures that only books popular with the Church were accepted. The implications of this are obvious. We have already seen why there is no reason to expect that first century non-Christians would have taken critical notice of Christianity. But suppose that assumption is entirely incorrect. If, say, the first-century Roman historian Suetonius had written a book entitled, &#8220;The Full Grave of Jesus,&#8221; documenting in intricate detail that the Resurrection was a hoax, the early church would have excluded such a book from the New Testament. Therefore, the criteria for Canonicity identified by Metzger do not support his claims of historical reliability. To paraphrase a comment made by Strobel, these criteria were &#8220;loaded from the outset, like dice that are weighted so they yield the result that was desired all along&#8221; (p. 156).</p>



<p>(c) <b><u><a id="corroborating" name="corroborating"></a>Corroborating Evidence</u></b>: Strobel then interviewed Edwin Yamauchi about extra-biblical evidence that confirms the New Testament. Yamauchi first mentioned Josephus&#8217;s references to Jesus, stating that both the shorter and longer references provide independent confirmation of the historicity of Jesus (pp. 101-107). Although I agree with Yamauchi on this point,[<a href="#10">10</a>] the evidence for our position is not decisive and I think it is significant that Strobel did not interview someone who rejects the authenticity of both of these references. More important, the authentic references to Jesus in Josephus don&#8217;t corroborate the central theological claims of Jesus. Josephus does not provide any corroborating evidence for the virgin birth, divinity, miracles, or Resurrection of Jesus.</p>



<p>Yamauchi also claims that other ancient sources provide independent confirmation of the New Testament: Tacitus, Pliny the Younger, Thallus, the <i>Talmud</i>, and the writings of the early church fathers. However, there is no good reason to believe that any of these sources provide corroborating evidence. There is no reason to believe that Tacitus or Pliny the Younger relied on independent sources.[<a href="#11">11</a>] As for Thallus, the date of Thallus&#8217; writing is not known and therefore the reference could be based on Christian sources. It is not even known that Africanus correctly interpreted Thallus. As the Christian New Testament scholar R.T. France writes, Africanus does not give Thallus&#8217; words, &#8220;so we do not know whether Thallus actually mentioned Jesus&#8217; crucifixion, or whether this was Africanus&#8217; interpretation of a period of darkness which Thallus had not specifically linked with Jesus.&#8221;[<a href="#12">12</a>] The <i>Talmud</i> is inconclusive because it is late and much of the Talmudic portrayal of Jesus is a polemical response to Christian claims. Finally, the writings of the church fathers do not provide any independent confirmation; they were late and based on earlier Christian sources.</p>



<p>(d) <b><u><a id="scientific" name="scientific"></a>Scientific Evidence</u></b>: Does archaeology increase or decrease the credibility of the New Testament? This was the central theme of Strobel&#8217;s fourth interview, that of archaeologist John McRay. McRay notes that archaeology &#8220;doesn&#8217;t confirm that what Jesus Christ said is right. Spiritual truths cannot be proved or disproved by archaeological discoveries&#8221; (p. 127). However, Strobel argues that archaeology can increase the overall credibility of an ancient text if it shows the empirical claims of the text to be accurate. He writes, &#8220;if the minutiae check out, this is some indication&#8211;not conclusive proof but some evidence&#8211;that maybe the witness is being reliable in his or her overall account&#8221; (pp. 128-129). According to McRay, archaeology provides precisely that sort of evidence concerning the gospels. McRay claims that archaeological discoveries have corroborated several of the incidental details of Luke, and that archaeology has bolstered the credibility of John and Mark.</p>



<p>Yet at least three stories of the gospels are suspicious: (i) the census (reported in Luke); (ii) the existence of Nazareth; and (iii) the slaughter at Bethlehem (reported in Matthew only). I want to briefly comment on each of these &#8220;puzzles&#8221; and McRay&#8217;s explanations for them. Concerning (i), Luke claims that Augustus initiated a worldwide census; that a Roman census took place in Judaea or Galilee before the death of Herod in 4 BCE and that Quirinius was governor of Syria before 6 CE. Many historians reject these claims, arguing that there is no support for any of these claims and that the idea of an empire-wide tax is contrary to documented Roman practice. McRay quoted London Papyrus 904 (dated 104 CE) as evidence that censuses were common Roman practice. However, the census referenced in the London Papyrus asked people to return to their <i>current</i> place of residence to enroll; it did not ask citizens to return to their <i>birthplace</i>.[<a href="#13">13</a>] As for Luke&#8217;s claim that the census took place while Quirinius was governor <i>and</i> during the reign of Herod the Great, Luke simply conflated the death of Herod (4 BCE) and the exile of Archelaus and the incorporation of Judaea into the empire (CE 6).[<a href="#14">14</a>] Historian Larry Taylor writes, &#8220;Fitzmyer, in the <i>Anchor Bible</i>, surveys the wreckage of all the attempts to save the accuracy of Luke. All of the approaches are failures.&#8221;[<a href="#15">15</a>]</p>



<p>(ii) Although there are no references to Nazareth in any written source outside the gospels before the fourth century,[<a href="#16">16</a>] I agree with Strobel that Nazareth probably existed. Even Earl Doherty, a secular humanist who denies that Jesus ever existed, writes, &#8220;It is impossible to &#8216;establish&#8217; that Nazareth did not exist in the early first century, since no one tells us this fact. And &#8230; no one makes statements or offers other evidence which would lead us to draw such a conclusion.&#8221;[<a href="#17">17</a>] Moreover, the existence of Nazareth is simply not intrinsically improbable. Therefore the gospels do not require independent confirmation on this point; the gospels alone are sufficient historical evidence to make it probable that Nazareth existed in the first century.</p>



<p>Finally, (iii). Matthew&#8217;s claim that Herod the Great ordered the slaughter of the children of Bethlehem is unlikely because the Gospel of Matthew is the <i>only</i> historical source to report this alleged event. In response to questioning by Strobel on this point, McRay offered various reasons why the incident would not have been of interest to other writers. If the story had been included in other New Testament documents I might buy McRay&#8217;s explanations, but the Slaughter of the Innocents is not even mentioned in the New Testament outside of Matthew. That fact is more likely on the hypothesis that the Slaughter of the Innocents never happened than on the hypothesis that the Slaughter of the Innocents is historical. Even Strobel admits it is &#8220;difficult to imagine&#8221; that no other writer mentioned this event, on the assumption that the Slaughter of the Innocents really happened (p. 140).</p>



<p>Moreover, at least three New Testament claims are completely unsupported by archaeology: first, the three hours of global darkness during the crucifixion (Mark 15:33 and synoptic parallels), second, the resurrection of the saints, and their subsequent appearance to many in Jerusalem (Matthew 27:52-53), and, third, the tomb of Jesus has never been located.</p>



<p>(e) <b><u><a id="rebuttal" name="rebuttal"></a>Rebuttal Evidence</u></b>: As Strobel explains, &#8220;rebuttal evidence&#8221; is a legal term for &#8220;any proofs that&#8217;s offered to &#8216;explain, counteract, or disprove&#8217; a witness&#8217;s account&#8221; (p. 147). Strobel classifies the work and findings of the Jesus Seminar as &#8220;rebuttal evidence&#8221; presumably because the Jesus Seminar challenges many traditional claims about the New Testament. For example, the Jesus Seminar maintains that important information about the historical Jesus may be found outside the New Testament (e.g., the Gospel of Thomas); that Jesus did not say 82 percent of what the gospels attribute to him; and that Jesus probably was not resurrected from the dead.</p>



<p>Incredibly, Strobel&#8217;s discussion of this &#8220;rebuttal evidence&#8221; does not even include a <i>summary</i> of that evidence. Not only did Strobel fail to interview a single member of the Jesus Seminar, Strobel neglected to quote or even summarize the Jesus Seminar&#8217;s arguments for their position. Instead, Strobel chose to interview an avowed enemy of the Jesus Seminar&#8211;Greg Boyd&#8211;and wrote a chapter that is full of a conclusionary statements but short on arguments which support these conclusions. For example, Strobel quotes Boyd as making the following accusation: &#8220;They rule out the possibility of the supernatural from the beginning, and they say, &#8216;Now bring on the evidence about Jesus.&#8217; No wonder they get the results they do!&#8221; (p. 155). Nowhere in the book does Boyd or Strobel provide any evidence to support this assertion. Moreover, I think the leaders of the Jesus Seminar have made it quite clear that they do not &#8220;rule out the possibility of the supernatural from the beginning.&#8221; For example, Robert Funk, director of the Westar Institute, writes, &#8220;Nothing is impossible, unless we exclude logical impossibilities, such as square circles.&#8221;[<a href="#18">18</a>] And Crossan explicitly denied this accusation in a debate with William Lane Craig. Crossan stated that he believed miraculous healings really did happen at Lourdes and that the supernatural &#8220;<i>always</i> &#8230; operates through the screen of the natural.&#8221;[<a href="#19">19</a>] Elsewhere, Crossan writes, &#8220;I leave absolutely open what God <i>could</i> do.&#8221;[<a href="#20">20</a>] Crossan may not accept the historicity of all the miracles his Evangelical counterparts have faith in, but that does not imply he denies the <i>possibility</i> of miracles.</p>



<p>Boyd says that we should reject the hypothesis that Matthew and Luke used Mark because &#8220;an increasing number of scholars are expressing serious reservations&#8221; about that theory (p. 157), as if the results of New Testament scholarship were determined by a majority vote! (In a field composed almost exclusively of people who have dedicated their entire lives to Christianity, I personally would find it significant if even only a few scholars challenged orthodox views.) More important, we are never told <i>why</i> we should reject the theory that Matthew and Luke used Mark. One cannot help but wonder what Boyd and Strobel would say about the Jesus Seminar if the Jesus Seminar argued in this manner.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Part II: &#8220;Analyzing Jesus&#8221;</h3>



<p>I personally found this section to be the least interesting part of the book, but I think I understand why Strobel, as a Christian apologist, needed to include it in his book. Like the late C.S. Lewis, Strobel is (presumably) &#8220;trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: &#8216;I&#8217;m ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don&#8217;t accept His claim to be God.'&#8221;[<a href="#21">21</a>] Lewis&#8217;s argument was that if we believe Jesus said the things the New Testament attributes to Him, then we must believe that Jesus claimed to be God. And if we believe that claim is false, then it makes no sense to maintain that Jesus was &#8220;a great moral teacher.&#8221; He was either insane or a compulsive liar.</p>



<p>(a) <b><u><a id="identity" name="identity"></a>Identity Evidence</u></b>: Lewis&#8217;s point is well-taken, but what reason is there to believe that Jesus really did claim to be God? Strobel interviewed Ben Witherington III, who referenced several passages from the New Testament in which Jesus allegedly claimed or implied that he was God. Yet Strobel did not interview any of the scholars who deny the authenticity of those passages.[<a href="#22">22</a>] But suppose that Jesus really did claim to be God. If Jesus was wrong about that, does it follow that Jesus was not &#8220;a great moral teacher,&#8221; as Lewis suggested? Not necessarily. It seems to me that the claim, &#8220;Jesus was a great moral teacher,&#8221; must be evaluated in light of Jesus&#8217; behavior and Jesus&#8217; moral teachings. If Jesus claimed to be God but was lying, then I would agree with Lewis that Jesus was not a great moral teacher. If, however, Jesus sincerely thought he was God but was mistaken, I would conclude that Jesus was severely deluded but I would leave the door open about his moral teachings until I examined them in their own light.</p>



<p>(b) <b><u><a id="psychological" name="psychological"></a>Psychological Evidence</u></b>: &#8220;Was Jesus crazy when he claimed to be God?&#8221; Despite the fact that no contemporary critic of Christianity claims that Jesus was crazy, this question was the topic for Strobel&#8217;s interview of psychologist Gary Collins! Perhaps Strobel would reply that insofar as the evidence indicates that Jesus was not insane, that evidence indirectly increases the probability that Jesus was the Son of God. But can psychology really show this to be the case?</p>



<p>Collins states that Jesus was not crazy because he did not exhibit the behavior of someone who is mentally disturbed. Collins says, &#8220;I just don&#8217;t see signs that Jesus was suffering from any known mental illness&#8221; (p. 197). On the face of it, I find the very premise of Strobel&#8217;s interview to be absurd. A psychologist simply cannot make a diagnosis concerning the sanity of a person who has not walked the Earth for almost 2,000 years. (I also wonder if Collins, as someone who believes he has a personal relationship with Jesus, can really be objective concerning Jesus&#8217; sanity.) Even if we accept Strobel&#8217;s arguments in Part 1 for the empirical accuracy of the New Testament, I can&#8217;t think of any reason to believe the writers of the New Testament were even qualified to accurately report the psychological tendencies of Jesus, no matter how sincere the writers may have been. John 10:20 reports that many Jews thought Jesus was &#8220;demon-possessed and raving mad;&#8221; yet Collins rejects that belief, arguing &#8220;that&#8217;s hardly a diagnosis by a trained mental health professional&#8221; (p. 197). Indeed. But I fail to see why the Christian writers of the New Testament were any more qualified as &#8220;mental health professionals&#8221; (or reporters on psychologically-relevant data) than first-century Jews! The upshot is that psychology provides no evidence&#8211;however indirect&#8211;for the claim that Jesus was God Incarnate.</p>



<p>(c) <b><u><a id="profile" name="profile"></a>Profile Evidence</u></b>: Summarizing a conversation with theologian Donald A. Carson, Strobel&#8217;s argument seems to be that Jesus &#8220;fit&#8221; the Old Testament&#8217;s profile of God as someone who is omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent, eternal, immutable, loving, holy, righteous, and just (p. 209). In order to justify that claim, Strobel must provide a <i>positive</i> argument for believing that Jesus possessed all of the divine attributes. Yet Strobel spent the majority of his chapter answering <i>objections</i> to the claim that Jesus possessed various divine attributes. Strobel only attempted to provide a positive argument for believing that Jesus was morally perfect and forgave the sins of mankind. He did not provide positive arguments for believing that Jesus is omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent, eternal, immutable, and loving.</p>



<p>Besides, the gospels themselves provide good reasons for doubting that Jesus was God Incarnate. Jesus was clearly not omnipresent. Jesus said, &#8220;Not even the Son of Man knows the hour of his return,&#8221; which implies that Jesus was not all-knowing. The gospels state that Jesus was unable to do many miracles in his hometown. Therefore, it certainly <i>seems</i> that Jesus did not fit the profile of God.[<a href="#23">23</a>]</p>



<p>Nonetheless, Carson maintains that Jesus was (and is) God Incarnate. Despite Jesus&#8217;s humanlike characteristics, Carson suggests that Jesus was fully human and only &#8220;functioned like God when his heavenly Father gave him explicit sanction to do so&#8221; (p. 215). Yet, as Carson admitted, the problem with that explanation is that &#8220;there is a sense in which the eternal Son has always acted in line with his Father&#8217;s commandments&#8221; (p. 215). While I praise Carson for his intellectual integrity, this seems to leave Strobel&#8217;s argument rather empty. Strobel provides no positive argument(s) for the claim that Jesus possessed <i>all</i> of the divine attributes. Moreover, Carson&#8217;s explanation for the humanness of Jesus is simply unsuccessful and relies on yet another questionable Christian doctrine: the Trinity.[<a href="#24">24</a>]</p>



<p>Another objection to the claim Jesus possessed all of the divine attributes is that, according to the gospels, Jesus taught the doctrine of Hell. According to that doctrine, Hell is permanent and inescapable for those who wind up there. Even if the people in Hell sincerely changed their behavior and attitudes, they could <i>never</i> escape from Hell. This doctrine is difficult to reconcile with the claim that Jesus, as God Incarnate, is loving, because a finite sin does not warrant an infinite punishment. In legal terminology, eternal damnation is &#8220;cruel and unusual punishment.&#8221; The punishment is totally out of proportion with <i>any</i> conceivable crime.</p>



<p>(d) <b><u><a id="fingerprint" name="fingerprint"></a>Fingerprint Evidence</u></b>: Strobel&#8217;s final line of evidence for the Incarnation is the familiar argument from prophecy; his interview subject was Louis Lapides. Lapides argues that Jesus (as Messiah) was actually <i>predicted</i> by the Old Testament prophets. Much like the chapter on &#8220;rebuttal evidence,&#8221; this chapter consists mainly of conclusionary statements with almost no supporting argumentation! I will therefore simply state that all of the alleged &#8220;prophecies&#8221; cited by Lapides have been answered by skeptics&#8211;none of whom were interviewed by Strobel&#8211;and that interested parties should consult Tim Callahan&#8217;s recent book, <i>Bible Prophecy</i>, for a well-researched response to the argument from prophecy.[<a href="#25">25</a>]</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Part III: &#8220;Researching the Resurrection&#8221;</h3>



<p>The third part defends the Resurrection. Strobel begins by defending the historicity of the Crucifixion of Jesus. He then seems to present an inference to the best explanation. He never explicitly formulates his argument for the Resurrection, but it seems to be this: the Resurrection is the best explanation for the alleged historical facts of the empty tomb, post-Resurrection appearances, and other circumstantial evidence.</p>



<p>(a) <b><u><a id="medical" name="medical"></a>Medical Evidence</u></b>: Here I agree with Strobel. The evidence for the historicity of the Crucifixion makes it more likely than not that Jesus really was crucified by the Romans. As Funk, no apologist for Evangelical Christianity, writes, &#8220;Most scholars agree that Jesus was executed by crucifixion on the authority of Pontius Pilate in Jerusalem.&#8221;[<a href="#26">26</a>] Although, as Funk notes, &#8220;We know very few things for certain about the death of Jesus and the events that led up to it,&#8221; those uncertainties do not undermine the historicity of the Crucifixion itself.[<a href="#27">27</a>]</p>



<p>(b) <b><u><a id="missing" name="missing"></a>Evidence of the Missing Body</u></b>: Strobel questioned theologian William Lane Craig. &#8220;In preparing for my interview with Craig,&#8221; Strobel writes, &#8220;I had gone to the Internet sites of several <i>atheist</i> organizations to see the kind of arguments they were raising against the Resurrection&#8221; (p. 294, my italics), as if atheism were the only alternative to the empty tomb story! Apparently, Strobel visited the Secular Web for he quotes a section of my essay on the Resurrection on p. 295 (but he does not give the URL for that essay or mention my name).[<a href="#28">28</a>] Yet Strobel never acknowledges the existence of New Testament scholar Robert Price&#8217;s rebuttal to <i>Craig&#8217;s</i> apologetic for the Resurrection, available on the Secular Web![<a href="#29">29</a>]</p>



<p>At the beginning of his chapter on the empty tomb, Strobel makes the following howler of an observation: Craig &#8220;seems genuinely perplexed why some people cannot, or will not, recognize the reality of the empty tomb&#8221; (p. 278). I, in turn, am genuinely perplexed by Craig&#8217;s (apparent) perplexity! New Testament scholars who deny the empty tomb story at least claim to do so on historical grounds; I am perfectly happy to accept <i>their</i> explanation for <i>their</i> rejection of the empty tomb story.</p>



<p>(c) <b><u><a id="appearances" name="appearances"></a>The Evidence of Appearances</u></b>: By itself, an empty tomb does not entail that a dead body came back to life. Therefore, in order to show that Jesus&#8217; corpse was revivified, Strobel has to show that Jesus was alive again after his death. Yet, contra Strobel and Gary Habermas, there just does not seem to be any reason to believe that 1 Corinthians 15, our earliest source concerning the Resurrection, implies that Jesus physically appeared to people after his death. Where English Bibles say &#8220;appear,&#8221; the original Greek uses the word &#8220;ophthe.&#8221; The Greek word &#8220;ophthe&#8221; can describe either a physical appearance or a nonphysical vision. And Mark, the earliest gospel, does not contain any appearance stories. Only the later gospels (Matthew, Luke, and John) include any appearance stories. Thus, if we compare the New Testament accounts of the Resurrection to one another, it certainly <i>appears</i> that the story has grown with the retelling. Only if we read the later gospels into 1 Corinthians would we assume that Paul was describing a physical appearance. Yet if we do not have any reports of a physical, post-mortem appearance of Jesus until the gospels of Matthew, Luke, and John, it seems unlikely that the appearance stories of those gospels are historical.</p>



<p>(d) <b><u><a id="circumstantial" name="circumstantial"></a>Circumstantial Evidence</u></b>: &#8220;Circumstantial evidence,&#8221; writes Strobel, &#8220;is made up of indirect facts from which inferences can be drawn&#8221; (p. 330). In his final interview, Strobel asked Christian philosopher J.P. Moreland to provide &#8220;five pieces of circumstantial evidence&#8221; that convince him of the Resurrection. Moreland provided six: (i) the disciples died for their beliefs; (ii) the conversion of skeptics; (iii) changes to key social structures; (iv) communion and baptism; (v) the emergence of the church; and (vi) the religious experience of Christians.</p>



<p>Concerning (i), Moreland claims that most of the disciples &#8220;were executed in torturous ways&#8221; for their belief that &#8220;Jesus Christ was the Messiah of God who died on a cross, returned to life, and was seen alive by them&#8221; (p. 333). However, this argument is multiply flawed. First, as Strobel points out, &#8220;Muslims and Mormons and followers of Jim Jones and David Koresh&#8221; (p. 333) were also willing to die for their beliefs. Therefore, the fact that the disciples were willing to die for their beliefs would increase the probability of the Resurrection only if the disciples were in a position to &#8220;know for sure&#8221; (p. 334) if the Resurrection really happened. Yet the earliest sources on the Resurrection (1 Corinthians 15, Mark) do not even imply that Jesus&#8217; corpse was revivified; therefore, there is no reason to believe that the disciples were in a position to &#8220;know for sure&#8221; if Jesus&#8217; corpse came back to life! Second, Galatians 6:12 makes clear that early Christians were persecuted because they had relaxed the rules on circumcision and the law&#8211;not because of the Resurrection&#8211;and that some early Christians actually compromised their beliefs in the face of persecution.[<a href="#30">30</a>]</p>



<p>The evidence for (ii) is inconclusive. First, it is simply an exaggeration to assert, as many Christian apologists do, that James the brother of Jesus was at one time <i>skeptical</i> of Christianity. Yes, James was a non-Christian who later converted to Christianity, but there is no evidence in the New Testament to support the assertion that James was an <i>enemy</i> of Christianity. Moreover, one need not assume the Resurrection in order to explain the conversion of James. According to Robert Price,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The answer is not far to seek. He was the eldest brother of King Messiah. Once honored for this accident of birth, he did not see fit to decline it. One might well remain aloof to a movement in which one&#8217;s brother was the leader yet soon warm to it once the leadership role were offered to oneself.[<a href="#31">31</a>]</p></blockquote>



<p>Second, the story of Paul&#8217;s conversion is also open to serious question. Turning to Price again, he states:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The story of Paul&#8217;s conversion is hardly even hinted at in any of the writings attributed to him. And when you read about it in the book of Acts, this looks like an awful lot like two stories widely known at the tomb: the conversion of the persecutor Pentheus&#8211;persecutor of the Dionysian religion that&#8217;s told in Euripides&#8217; play, <i>The Bacchae</i>&#8211;and the conversion against his will of Heliodorus, the agent of Antiogas Epiphanes, 2 Maccabees. [These are] both texts that the author of Acts would certainly have known as an educated person. His stories of Paul being converted don&#8217;t sound much like Paul&#8217;s epistles but do sound like this.[<a href="#32">32</a>]</p></blockquote>



<p>As for (iii)-(v), these facts are not even circumstantial evidence. They no more increase the probability of Christianity than, say, the emergence of the Mormon church increases the probability of Mormonism being true.</p>



<p>This leaves only (vi) the religious experience of Christians. Here I think it is important to distinguish truth from rationality. I do not believe Christianity is <i>true</i>, but I am perfectly happy to grant that it may be <i>rational</i> for Christians to believe Christianity on the basis of their experience.[<a href="#33">33</a>] Yet even granting that, there is no reason to believe that the religious experience of Christians is <i>evidence</i> for the Resurrection. Moreover, there are many people who have not had experiences of the Christian god; this fact cries out for an explanation.</p>



<p>One explanation, proposed by Theodore Drange in his recent book <i>Nonbelief and Evil</i>, is that the Christian god does not exist.[<a href="#34">34</a>] He argues that the mere fact of reasonable nonbelief in the world is evidence for the nonexistence of the Christian god. According to Drange, if the Christian god were to exist, He would want everyone to believe in Him. Drange suggests that, if the Christian god actually existed, He could do many things to bring about more believers in Him. He could provide good, objective evidence of His existence. He could reveal Himself to people through private, subjective religious experiences. He could create &#8220;belief genes,&#8221; giving people the genetic tendency to become Christians. And so forth. Yet there many, many people who do not believe the Christian god exists. This would be surprising if Christianity were true, but what we would expect if Christianity were false (and if the Resurrection never happened). The upshot is that reasonable nonbelief indirectly decreases the likelihood of the Resurrection.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a id="conclusion" name="conclusion"></a>Concluding Thoughts</h3>



<p><i>Case for Christ</i> is a creative, well-written contribution to Christian apologetics. Moreover, Strobel is to be commended for summarizing the work of so many leading apologists for Evangelical Christianity in such a compact and easy-to-read format. Yet Strobel did not interview <i>any</i> critics of Evangelical apologetics. He sometimes refutes at great length objections not made by the critics (e.g., the claim that Jesus was mentally insane); more often, he doesn&#8217;t address objections the critics <i>do</i> make (e.g., the unreliability of human memory, that non-Christian historians do not provide any independent confirmation for the deity of Jesus, etc.) Perhaps this will be a welcome feature to people who already believe Christianity but have no idea <i>why</i> they believe it. For those of us who are primarily interested in the <i>truth</i>, however, we want to hear both sides of the story.[<a href="#35">35</a>]</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a id="addendum" name="addendum"></a>Addendum (11/29/00)</h3>



<p>Since the original publication of my review, I was pleased by the amount of attention it has received, including <a href="/library/modern/jeff-lowder-strobel2/">a mention on Hank Hanegraaff&#8217;s &#8220;Bible Answer Man&#8221; Radio Show</a>! But many readers have misunderstood my statement that Strobel &#8220;quotes a section of my essay on the Resurrection on p. 295 (but he does not give the URL for that essay or mention my name).&#8221; If Strobel&#8217;s book had been promoted only as an apologetic, I would have no objection. But Strobel&#8217;s book was promoted as more than just another Christian apologetics book; it was promoted as the result of an investigation into Christianity by an investigative reporter. My point was simply that we would normally expect a journalist to identify their sources, and Strobel&#8217;s refusal to even mention my name is yet another example of how Strobel&#8217;s book was not written according to the standards of contemporary journalism.</p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="/library/modern/jeff-lowder-empty/">Historical Evidence and the Empty Tomb Story: A Reply to William Lane Craig</a>&#8221; (2001)</p>



<p>Lowder provides a point-by-point rebuttal to Craig&#8217;s case for the empty tomb. Along the way, Lowder defends a naturalistic explanation of the empty tomb. He concludes that historians should be agnostic about the empty tomb story.</p>



<p>&#8220;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070908121334/http://pages.ca.inter.net:80/~oblio/StrobelIntro.htm">Challenging the Verdict: A Cross-Examination of Lee Strobel&#8217;s <i>The Case for Christ</i></a>&#8221; (2001) by <a href="https://infidels.org/author/earl-j-doherty/">Earl Doherty</a> [Off Site]</p>



<p>Doherty critiques Strobel&#8217;s book, in order &#8220;to expose the fallacy, distortion of evidence, and basic misrepresentation inherent in the &#8220;case&#8221; for Christian orthodoxy as presented by this consortium of reactionary scholarly opinion.&#8221;</p>
