Previous battles in Arabia had mainly centered on tribal differences and were confined to bouts of squabbling with some fights. With the introduction of Islam came not only war, but also an unrelenting genocide and terror that would quickly become integral components in furthering Islam's expansionism. </font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 5pt 0in; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none"><font color="#000000" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The early years of Muhammad's prophetic carrier, in his native town Mecca, were peaceful. After 13 year of preaching no more than 70 or 80 people had embraced his cause. Not all of them were able fighting men. That explains why those early years were peaceful. Muslims did not have the strength to fight. However soon after Muhammad migrated and settled in Medina, and the Arab population of that town accepted his religion, he began invading and looting first the merchant caravans and then the human settlements to survive and to provide for his followers who had accompanied him and because of their lack of expertise had a difficult time finding employments in Medina. </font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">When the Muslims migrated from Makkah to Medina, they left all their possessions in Makkah. Later on the Quraysh took all the possessions of the Muslims in Makkah, and led by Abu Sufyan they took all those possessions to Syria so that it could be sold. So If Ali Sina is referring to the caravans that held Muslim belongings that were to be sold, then I see no problem that it was attacked. Let's ask Ali Sina if someone would take all his belongings in his house, then sell them, would Ali Sina just sit quietly, and let people take his possessions and sell it? I don't think so. Let us also note that this was how the Battle of Badr began. (Note: It wasn't just one caravan, it was many but The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) intercepted the caravan specifically led by Abu Sufyan mainly because it would deliver a big blow to the Meccan glory, and Abu Sufyan, who learned of these intentions, led his caravan out of the main route and inclined it towards the Red Sea. Abu Sufyan sent a messenger to the Quraysh, telling them:</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none"><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Also, I want to add on the fact that the Quraysh began to make preparations<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>for an attack on Medina, which they believed would exterminate the nascent power of Islam. But before fighting the decisive battle they were anxious to enlist the support and sympathies<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>of the Non-Muslim tribes living around Medina.</font><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (See</strong> </font></font></font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3"><b>Abdul Hameed Siddiqui, <i>The Life of Muhammad peace be upon him</i>, p. 175-176).</b></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Ali Sina states in his article that Muhammad (peace be upon him) attacked human settlements to survive and to provide for his followers "soon after" he migrated to Medina. I honestly don't know what is his source. If he is referring to the attacks on the surroundings tribes, then we'll get to that later on Insha'Allah. But here is how Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) helped the Muhajirun (emigrants from Makkah) who left everything in Makkah:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none"><font color="#000000" size="3"></font></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none"><font color="#ff0000" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Prayers being thus regulated, the Prophet next turned his attention to cementing the ties of brotherhood amongst the Muslims of Medina who were called Ansar, and the Muhajirun, i.e., emigrants from Mecca. It was a necessary step since the refugees who had left their hearths and homes and had said goodbye to friends and relatives were feeling lonely. To raise their feelings of loneliness, and to attune them to the changed circumstances, a new fraternity was established amongst the Muslims of Mecca and those of Medina. </font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none"><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">This brotherhood was indeed unique in the history of the world. The fellow-feeling and love on which this new relationship was established found a wonderful expression. For example Sa'd b. Sabi a Helper said to his fellow brother 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Awf, " I am the richest man amongst the Helpers. I am glad to share my property half and half with you. I have two wives, I am ready to divorce one, and after the expiry of 'iddah, you may marry her." But 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Awf was not prepared to accept anything : neither property nor home. So he blessed his brothers and said : " Kindly direct me to the markets so that I may make my fortune with my own hands." The Helpers were extremely generous to their brethren-in-faith. They once approached the Holy Prophet with the request that their orchards should be distributed equally between the Muslims of Medina and their brethren from Mecca. But the Prophet however, decided that the refugees would work in the orchards along with the Helpers and the yield would be divided equally amongst them. </font><b><font color="#000000">(<font face="Times New Roman">Abdul Hameed Siddiqui, <i>The Life of Muhammad </i></font></font></b><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman"><i><b>peace be upon him</b></i><b>, p. 138-139).</b></font></font></font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Now continuing with Ali Sina's argument... </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; </font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none"><font face="Times New Roman"><b><u><font size="5">Ali Sina said:</font></u></b><font size="3"> </font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The fifth year of hijrah (migration to Medina) was an eventful year. That was the year that Muslims fought the famous war of the ditch against the Meccans and soon after that they surrounded the Jewish quarter of Bani Qaynuqa of Medina who were a prosperous population of goldsmiths and blacksmiths and after confiscating their properties (vineyards and homes) and belongings (jewelry and arms) they were banished from their ancestral home. After that he set his sight on another Jewish tribe, the Bani Nadir. He did a similar thing to them. He killed their leaders and many of their able-bodied men and after confiscating their properties and much of their wealth, expelled the rest from Medina. In neither of these cases the Jews offered any resistance. They were taken by surprise and simply surrendered under the superior forces of Muhammad's men. </font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Ali Sina is good at telling people the battle, but he never gives the reason as to WHY the battles took place. So let's take a trip down history lane, and educate Ali Sina. </font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The Battle of Uhud had a number of effects on the enemies of Islam. They were, on the one hand, very much perturbed by the growing strength of Muslims but the happenings in Uhud had, on the other hand supplied fresh vigor to their drooping spirits and they had begun to think of the extermination of the Divine Faith. </font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Jews found a suitable opportunity to stab the Muslims in the back who had already been hit hard in the Battle of 'Uhud. They perceived that that their concentrated efforts could easily precipitate the ruin of Islam. The first treacherous act that they did was to open secret communications with the Quraysh casting aside their agreements with the Muslims. Moreover, they strained every nerve to produce general dissatisfaction and bitterness against the Holy Prophet, his teachings and faithful companions. A campaign of slander was organized against Islam and its followers. The sacred words of the Holy Qur'an were deliberately mispronounced in order to pervert their meanings. Satirical poems were enthusiastically sung at public places in which the religion of Allah was abjectly ridiculed. Muslim ladies were insulted and offended by obscene and amatory madrigals. Inflammatory poems were recited with a view to keeping this animosity of the hostile tribes alive.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Life was thus made hard for the followers of Muhammad (peace be upon him). The Holy Prophet was keeping a watch over their seditious activities. He first approached the tribe of Qaynuqa and asked them to honor the pact which they had concluded with him. But they did not pay heed to his advice. They had become over-confident of their power since they had been assured help from from other tribes. Their reply was defiant through and they betook themselves to fortified strongholds. The Prophet laid siege to them and kept it for fifteen days after which they became entirely helpless for want of any external help and thus surrendered themselves. The Prophet then ordered them to leave Medina and settle somewhere else. Thus banished, they went to Khaybar and settled there. </font></font></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#ff0000" size="3">Similar was the treatment meted out to Banu Nadir another important Jewish tribe.

Buraidah bin Al-Haseeb Al-Aslami was immediately despatched to verify the reports. He had some words with Abi Dirar, who confirmed his intention of war. He later sent a reconnoiterer to explore the positions of the Muslims but he was captured and killed. The Prophet [peace be upon him] summoned his men and ordered them to prepare for war. Before leaving, Zaid bin Haritha was mandated to see to the affairs of Madinah and dispose them. On hearing the advent of the Muslims, the disbelievers got frightened and the Arabs going with them defected and ran away to their lives. Abu Bakr was entrusted with the banner of the Emigrants, and that of the Helpers went to Sa'd bin 'Ubada. The two armies were stationed at a well called Muraisi. Arrow shooting went on for an hour, and then the Muslims rushed and engaged with the enemy in a battle that ended in full victory for the Muslims. Some men were killed, women and children of the disbelievers taken as captives, and a lot of booty fell to the lot of the Muslims. Only one Muslim was killed by mistake by a Helper. Amongst the captives was Juwairiyah, daughter of Al-Harith, chief of the disbelievers. The Prophet [peace be upon him] married her and, in compensation, the Muslims had to manumit a hundred others of the enemy prisoners who embraced Islam, and were then called the Prophet's in-laws.</span> <b><span style="COLOR: black">[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/112,113; Ibn Hisham 2/289,290,294,295]</span></b></font></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> &nbsp;</font></p>

In 527 C.E. news was brought to Madina that the Banu Mustaliq in alliance with some other tribes were gathering to make a raid on Madina. The policy of the Holy Prophet was that the Muslims should not lose the initiative in such cases, and should take such tribes by surprise. Another aspect of the policy was that action against individual tribes should be taken before they could effect an alliance.</font></p>

Nevertheless, to his chagrin, the Jews had no interest in his religion and he never forgave them for that. You cannot reject a narcissist without invoking his rage. Muhammad was so upset that he changed the direction of the Qiblah (the direction towards which the Muslims pray) from Jerusalem to Kaaba, which at that time was just a temple of idols and said Allah transformed the Jews were transformed into apes and swine because of their transgression (Q.</font><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/005.qmt.html"><font face="Times New Roman"> 5:60</font></a><font face="Times New Roman">) and (Q. </font><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/002.qmt.html"><font face="Times New Roman">2:65</font></a><font face="Times New Roman">). Muhammad made the Jews the scapegoat to rally his followers around himself. He was an expert of that old trick known as "divide n' conquer". The Arabs of Medina were generally a bunch of illiterate folk with little skills and often poor who made their living by working in the vineyards of the Jews and rendering other services to them. They where originally immigrants from Yemen while the Jews were the masters of trades and the owners of the lands who had called Medina home, for 2000 years. They were easy targets. Prowling their wealth and making more money by enslaving their women and children and distributing them among the poor Arabs while giving them the assurance that killing their masters and bread givers is not only ethical but also sanctioned by God proved a very lucrative enterprise for Muhammad, one that would change his fortunes, and set this new religion on its eventual path of war and military conquests. </font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 5pt 0in; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none"><font color="#000000" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">"The news of the advance of Muslim forces had already reached Haris. In panic, his men deserted him and he himself took refuge in some unknown place. But the local population of Muraisa took up arms against the Muslims and rained showers of arrows in a sustained manner. The Muslims launched a sudden and furious attack and routed the enemy, who suffered huge casualties and nearly 600 were taken prisoners by the Muslims. Among the booty there were 2,000 camels and 5,000 goats.<br>
The prisoners of war included Barra, the daughter of Haris, who later on became Hazrat Juwairiyah, the consort of the Holy Prophet. According to the prevailing practice all the prisoners were made slaves and distributed among the victorious Muslim soldiers. Hazrat Juwairiyah fell to the lot of Thabit bin Qais. She was the daughter of the leader of the clan, and therefore, very much felt the discomfiture and disgrace of being made slave of an ordinary Muslim soldier. Therefore, she requested him to release her on payment of ransom. Thabit agreed to this, if she could pay him 9 Auqias of gold. Hazrat Juwairiyah had no ready money with her. She tried to raise this amount through contributions, and approached the Holy Prophet also in this connection. She said to him "0' Prophet of Allah! I am the daughter of Al Haris bin Zarar, the Lord (chief) of his people. You know that it is by chance that our people have fallen captive and I have fallen to the share of Thabit bin Qais and have requested him to release me considering my status, but he has refused. Please do an act of kindness and save me from humiliation". The Holy Prophet was moved and asked the captive woman if she would like a thing still better. She asked as to what was that thing. He said that he was ready to pay her ransom and marry her if she liked. She agreed to this proposal. So the Holy Prophet (sallal alaho alahie wasallam) paid the amount of ransom and married her." </font></font></p>

Interestingly Muhammad makes his Allah praise him with verses such as the following: "And surely thou hast sublime morals" (Quran </font><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/068qmt.html"><font face="Times New Roman">68:4</font></a><font face="Times New Roman">). and "Indeed in the Messenger of Allah you have a good example to follow" (Quran </font><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/033qmt.html"><font face="Times New Roman">33:21</font></a><font face="Times New Roman">).

The narrator says, "According to the prevailing practice all the prisoners were made slaves and distributed among the victorious Muslim soldiers." As we read the history of Islam, we see this WAS indeed the prevailing practice of the Muslim Mujahedin, throughout the bloody history of Islam. Yet the question remains unanswered.

His real aim was power, wealth and domination. Religion was just the pretext he used to subdue and conquer those he first sought to have dominion over. He weighed each case differently and considered its financial benefits. In most cases it was more profitable if the people did not convert to Islam, but killed and their belongings taken as spoils of war and their wives and children enslaved and soled with huge profits. This could bring sudden wealth to this "messenger of God" that otherwise he could not have. If people were given the choice they could have feared defeat and the harsh consequences and they could have accepted Islam. This would have impeded Muslims of looting them, which meant loss of profit. That is why Muhammad did not deem appropriate to warn the Bani Mustaliq just as he never warned his other victims but attacked them by surprise. </font><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; </font></font></p>

Only after a town had been decimated and all the young women and children that could be sold as slaves were captured would the brutal campaign of Islamization, with its brutal mandate that all must convert or die, began. However the Jews and the Christians were given protection to live provided they pay a penalty tax called Jizyah and enter into dhimmitude. Dhimmi means protected. But the dhimmis had to pay a hefty jizyah for their protection. This Jizyah was the source of livelihood of the Muslims who through it were able to live like parasites off the labor of the dhimmis. The following Hadith, reported by Bukhari, records the source for this practice based on the admonitions of Muhammad toward the dhimmi: </font></font></p>

She was married to her cousin, who was killed during the battle. She gave Thabit a deed, agreeing to pay him nine okes of gold for her freedom. She was a very beautiful woman. She captivated every man who saw her. She came to the prophet-peace be upon him-, to ask for his help in the matter. As soon as I saw her at door of my room, I took a dislike to her, for I knew that he would see her as I saw her. She went in and told him who she was, the daughter of al-Harith ibn Dhirar, the chief of his people. She said: "you can see the state to which I have been brought. I have fallen to the lot of Thabit, and have given him a deed for ransom, and I have to come to ask your help in the matter.' He said: 'would you like something better than that? I will discharge your debt, and marry you.' she said: 'yes. O then it is messenger of Allah! Done.' he replied." http://66.34.76.88/alsalafiyat/juwairiyah.htm </font></font></p>

As it can be seen Muhammad murders the husband of Juwairiyah, who was also her cousin. Captivated by her beauty, he offers to free her, but only on the condition she marry him. After having come to Muhammad to plead for his help, this self declared Messenger of God, this self proclaimed "mercy of God for humanity", this self styled "example to follow" by all the Muslims presents her with a most unwelcome choice, for whose price is that she must surrender her freedom. What other choice could there possibly be for her? Muslims apologetics insists that most of Muhammad's wives were widows. They try to give the impression Muhammad married them as an act of charity. However as it becomes clear these women were young and beautiful. If they were widows, is because Muhammad murdered their husbands. Juwairiyah was just 20 years old then while Muhammad was 58. </font></font></p>

Apparently Muhammad did not like this name and so changed her name to Juwairiyah. Even the two Zeinabs who were his wives were previously called Barra and he changed their names as well to Zeinab, It would appear the Prophet had some guilt in becoming sexually intimate with women that were called "Pious". These seemingly incidental incidents reflect a certain hitherto humanity, a conscience, if you will, to his character, and perhaps hint at his own real, but hidden religiosity. Muhammad was certainly convinced of his own cause. However his understanding of reality was distorted as he had difficulty to distinguish between what is real and what is imagined. In fact Muhammad was more motivated by fear and superstitions than by conscience and ethics.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></p>

Ibn Abbas reported that the name of Juwairlya (the wife of the Holy Prophet) was Barra (Pious). Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) changed her name to Juwairiya and said: I did not like that it should be said: He had come out from Barra (Pious).

However, what is not so difficult to notice are the many contradictions contained within the main storyline. For instance, we read that Muhammad paid the ransom to Thabit the captor of Juwairiyah, and then married her after freeing her. Then we read that Hairth, the father of Juwairiyah also paid the ransom to set her free. As to the claims of Muhammad having some sort of psychic power, that empowered him to know or tell certain things in advance, for instance knowing certain information such as the whereabouts of camels, we can safely conclude that these claims are false. On many occasions Muhammad demonstrated precisely the opposite, and proved that he was by no means psychic, let alone prescient, as he failed to discern or to obtain through divine blessings the information he so desired. For instance, when he raided Khaibar, he tortured the treasurer of that town, even to the point of death, just so he could extract from him the information that would lead to the whereabouts of the city's treasures</font></p>

The Holy Prophet (sallal alaho alahie wasallam) said that "Would it not be better to leave the matter on the choice of his daughter". Haris then went to his daughter and told her that the Holy Prophet (sallal alaho alahie wasallam) had left the matter to her free will, and hoped that she would not bring disgrace to him. The prisoner replied that she preferred to remain in the services of the Holy Prophet (sallal alaho alahie wasallam). Thereafter the Holy Prophet (sallal alaho alahie wasallam) married her. Ibn-i-S'ad in his 'Tabaqat', states that the father of Hazrat Juwairiyah paid her ransom amount, and when she became free, the Holy Prophet (sallal alaho alahie wasallam) married her.

The source of this claim can be found in the book Usud-ul-Ghaba. There the author writes that whenever the Prophet used to come to Juwairiyah he would find her praying, then when he would return at a later time he still found her praying. One day he said to her: "Shall I tell you few words, if you say them they will be heavier in the scale than what you have done?

We pray to ask for forgiveness. The Prophet did not say that uttering such a statement is enough and the only thing required from us. Obviously it does not have the same effect as ACTUALLY praying 5 times a day to the person. Yes, it is a great reward to utter that statement but there is more required of us to do. That statement does bring great rewards but does not give the individually the complete benefits of getting closer to God.</font></p>

Chapter : The reciting of Subhan Allah in the morning and at the time of sleeping.<br>
<br>
Juwairiya reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) came out from (her apartment) in the morning as she was busy in observing her dawn prayer in her place of worship. He came back in the forenoon and she was still sitting there. He (the Holy Prophet) said to her: You have been in the same seat since I left you. She said: Yes. Thereupon Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: I recited four words three times after I left you and if these are to be weighed against what you have recited since morning these would outweigh them and (these words) are: "Hallowed be Allah and praise is due to Him according to the number of His creation and according to the pleasure of His Self and according to the weight of His Throne and according to the ink (used in recording) words (for His Praise)."</font></p>

Put yourself in the shoes of a young woman who has just fallen into the lot of a murderer of her husband who also happened to be her cousin! As relatives, they grew up together. They were more than just husband and wife. They were first playmates, then lovers and companions for life. If you were a woman in Juwairiyah's situation, how would you feel about the killer of your husband and many of your relatives and loved ones? Suppose further you don't have anywhere to go to. Without any viable options for escape, your only choice would be to surrender as a sex slave to this old man, one who is the king of his people and has plenty of money or to be given away to one of his soldiers. Under whose captivity would you rather be? I believe the answer is clear. Juwairiah had no choice but to accept Muhammad's offer to marry her. Now what would any woman do if such an old man as this came to her for sex or company? She probably would devise a survival ploy. That is what Juwairiyah did. Any time she noticed Muhammad is coming, she pretended that she was busy praying, hoping that he would leave her and go to his other wives to satisfy his wretched lust. Yet, as we see, Muhammad was a cunning old man. He soon prescribed a sentence and told her that this "will be heavier in the scale" than praying all day long, robbing her from excuses to shun him when he desired her.</font></font></p>

Now you assume that anytime Juwairiyah saw the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)) she pretended to pray!
