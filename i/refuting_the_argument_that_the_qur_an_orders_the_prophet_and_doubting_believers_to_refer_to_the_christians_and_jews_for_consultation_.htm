<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">I went to Abu Wail to ask him (about those who had rebelled against &#39;Ali). On that Abu Wail said, &quot;We were at Siffin (a city on the bank of the Euphrates, the place where me battle took place between &#39;Ali and Muawiya) A man said, &quot;Will you be on the side of those who are called to consult Allah&#39;s Book (to settle the dispute)?&quot; &#39;Ali said, &#39;Yes (I agree that we should settle the matter in the light of the Qur&#39;an).&quot; &#39; Some people objected to &#39;Ali&#39;s agreement and wanted to fight. On that Sahl bin Hunaif said, &#39;Blame yourselves! I remember how, on the day of Al-Hudaibiya (i.e. the peace treaty between the Prophet and the Quraish pagans), if we had been allowed to choose fighting, we would have fought (the pagans). At that time &#39;Umar came (to the Prophet) and said, &quot;Aren&#39;t we on the right (path) and they (pagans) in the wrong? Won&#39;t our killed persons go to Paradise, and theirs in the Fire?&quot; The Prophet replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; Umar further said, &quot;Then why should we let our religion be degraded and return before Allah has settled the matter between us?&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;O the son of Al-Khattab! <b><u>No doubt, I am Allah&#39;s Apostle and Allah will never neglect me.&quot;</u></b> So Umar left the place angrily and he was so impatient that he went to Abu Bakr and said, &quot;O Abu Bakr! Aren&#39;t we on the right (path) and they (pagans) on the wrong?&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;O the son of Al-Khattab! He is Allah&#39;s Apostle, and Allah will never neglect him.&quot; Then Sura Al-Fath (The Victory) was revealed.&quot; </font></font></p>

<p><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Dr. Muhammad M.

The Muslim point of view can be demonstrated by reference to Ibn Hazm, Ibn Taymiyyah and some other Muslim scholars. Ibn Hazm provides an interpretation of the verse in question and then answers his critic polemically. It is the author of <i>Al-Faisal</i> which is of prime interest here: it involves Ibn Hazm in an interpretation which at first sight seems to move outside the literalist theory to which he was committed, but in fact it does not go beyond his own definition of the Zahiriyya position. The rejection of exegesis, Ta&#39;wil, is not an outright rejection and permits its use when necessary in considering certain Qur&#39;anic passages and when it can be supported by scriptural evidence. </span></font></font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: red">Ibn Hazm insists that the interpretation exemplified by Ricoldo above originates with the People of the books, i.e. Christians and Jews, and with some others. Those who claim to be Muslim could never share such a view. <u><b>It is impossible that a Muslim should think that Muhammad (peace be upon him) doubted the Revelation from God.</b></u> Ibn Hazm refers to an essay, which he himself wrote on this subject. </span><b><span style="COLOR: black">(Ibn Hazm,<i> Al Faisal,</i> vol. 4, p. 50)</span></b><span style="COLOR: red"> This unfortunately does not appear among his writings, and was clearly not included as a section of Al-Faisal. Ibn Hazm, however, summarizes the argument of the essay in his comment on this verse. The confusion can be solved as follows: the word<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;In&quot; translated into English as<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;If&quot;, is synonymous with the conjunction &quot; Ma&quot;, which signifies refusal and denial. The verse thus reads nit &quot; if you are in doubt&quot;, but &quot;you are not in doubt&quot;</span>. <b><span style="COLOR: black">(</span><span style="COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Ibid., and [R. 2], p. 60)</span></b> <u><b><span style="COLOR: red">The author of Al-Faisal continues by saying that God commanded Muhammad (peace be upon him) to confer with the people of the books to confirm their knowledge of Muhammad (peace be upon him) as a prophet sent from God, as corroborated in the Torah and</span> <span style="COLOR: red">the Gospel.</span></b> </u><b><span style="COLOR: black">(Ibn Hazm,<i> Al Faisal,</i> vol. 4, p. 50)</span></b> <span style="COLOR: red">Ibn Hazm, as shown above, uses linguistic analysis in order to resolve the problem of a difficult verse, and in doing so follows a method of resolving its particular difficulties, which was not unique to him. At-Tabari and others had, in fact, reviewed a range of solutions to this verse of which Ibn Hazm&#39;s constituted only one of many possibilities. Any judgment of his argument needs to be placed against the alternative solutions described by at-Tabari. </span></font></font></p>

Ibn Taymiyyah shows himself concerned to analyze precisely what issues were to be referred to the People of the books. Firstly Muhammad (peace be upon him) was to ask the Jews about the way in which their scriptures confirm the warning against polytheism given by Moses and the prophets to the people (Qur&#39;an 43:45; 21:25; 16:43). Secondly, Muhammad (peace be upon him) was to ask the Jews to confirm that God appointed men, not angels, as prophets of His message (Qur&#39;an 17:95; 23:25; 10:1-2; 6:8-9; 21:7-8). Thirdly, the People of the books were to be asked about the work of the prophets among men, and the consequences of rejecting or accepting the prophets. Fourthly, they were to be asked about the common religion, i.e., Islam, the total devotion to the will of God as the fundamental source of all religions. This constituted monotheism, and injunctions that the people should be trustworthy, just and devoted to parents and relatives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Fifthly, the People of the books should be asked whether Muhammad&#39;s message was in accordance with the previous Prophets, and about the nature of Muhammad&#39;s prophecy (Qur&#39;an 7:156-157; 61:6). </span><b><span style="COLOR: black">(Ibn Taymiyyah, <i>Aj-Jawab As-Sahih</i>, vol. 1, pp. 334-341 and ff.) </span></b><span style="COLOR: red"><u><b>It is clear from the above that Ibn Taymiyyah seeks for common ground between the three religions, however he qualifies this by insisting that the passage in the Qur&#39;an in no way sanctions Christian practices and doctrines which have been invented and added to Jesus&#39; original teachings, such as the doctrine of the Trinity.</b></u> </span><b><span style="COLOR: black">(Dr. Muhammad M.

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">The Qur&#39;an and authentic traditions make it clear that the Prophet peace be upon him and believers have no doubts regarding their faith and that the verses of the Qur&#39;an need to be understood in its proper context.
