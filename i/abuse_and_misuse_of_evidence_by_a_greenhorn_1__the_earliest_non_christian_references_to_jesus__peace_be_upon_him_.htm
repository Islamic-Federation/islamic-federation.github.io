King Solomon is referred to as 'a wise man possessing every virtue' (<I>andri sopho kai pasan arêten echonti</I>) (<st1:place w:st="on"><I>Ant</I>.</st1:place> viii 53). The prophet Elisha was 'a man renowned for righteousness' (<I>aner epi dikaiosune diaboetos</I>) who performed <I>paradoxa erga</I> (<st1:place w:st="on"><I>Ant</I>.</st1:place> ix 182). Daniel, in turn, is portrayed as 'a wise man and skilful in discovering things beyond man's power' (<I>sophos aner kai deinos heurein ta anechana</I>) (<st1:place w:st="on"><I>Ant</I>.</st1:place> x 237). A little later he appears as 'a good and just man' (<I>aner agathos kai dikaios</I>) (<st1:place w:st="on"><I>Ant</I>.</st1:place> x 246).

John the Baptist is introduced as 'a good man' (<I>agathos aner</I>) who 'exhorted the Jews to lead righteous lives, to practice justice towards their fellows and piety towards God' (<st1:place w:st="on"><I>Ant</I>.</st1:place> xviii 117). As for the leading Pharisee at the time of the outbreak of the first revolution, Simeon ben Gamaliel, he is presented as 'a man highly gifted with intelligence and judgment' (<I>aner pleres suneseos kai logismou</I>) (<I>Vita</I> 192) ...</FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-FAMILY: Calibri"><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman">In brief, there seems to be no stylistic or historical argument that might be marshaled against the authenticity of the two phrases in question. In fact, the clause that follows 'wise man', viz. 'if indeed one might call him a man' (<I>eige andra auton legein chre</I>), which is generally recognized as an interpolation, seems to support - as Paul Winter has aptly pointed out - the originality of <I>sophos aner</I>, an idiom which in the mind of a later Christian editor required further qualification.</FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-FAMILY: Calibri"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>(2) <B>In addition to appearing <I>prima facie</I> to be Josephan</B>, closer analysis of <I>sophos aner</I> and <I>paradoxon ergon poeites</I><B> points to the improbability of their later Christian provenance</B>. To begin with, <B>the title 'wise man' has no New Testament roots</B>, and in the absence of such an authoritative backing it is, I think, totally unfit to express the kind of elevated theological notion that a forger would have intended to introduce into Josephus' text. <B>It would have been meaningless to <I>invent</I> a testimony that did not support the belief of the interpolator</B>. But not only does it fail to convey the idea of the divine Christ of the church; <B>it actually conflicts in a sense with New Testament terminology</B>. Jesus is admittedly twice identified by Paul in I Cor. 1:24 and 30 with the abstract 'wisdom of God', but the adjective <I>sophos</I> as applied to men in the same chapter (1:18-31) <B>carries a pejorative connotation</B>. Furthermore, on the only occasion where the Gospels put this word into the mouth of Jesus, 'the wise' are unfavourably compared to 'babes' (<I>nepioi</I>) (Matt. 11:25; Luke 10:21). In the few instances where the term <I>sophos</I> is employed positively, it relates to Christian teachers, <B>but never to Jesus himself</B>.

What should be noted here is that Tacitus implies by his phraseology that the Christian movement was already in existence before Christ's execution; otherwise, it could not have been "suppressed" for a brief period by his death. Thus could, of course, be just another example of a naive retrojection by a Greco-Roman historian; we have already seen an example in Josephus.

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>With Josephus we begin to actually acquire some useful details about Jesus (peace be upon him).

However, the Christian sources are also problematic and cannot be used and trusted blindly to learn about the historical Jesus (peace be upon him). We will discuss the problems with the Christians sources in another paper.</FONT></SPAN></P>
