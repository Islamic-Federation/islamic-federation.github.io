<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On January 21<sup>st</sup>, 2009 Christian apologist and polemicist James White had a debate with the prominent New Testament scholar Bart D. Ehrman, who also happens to be one of the foremost New Testament textual critics in the world today. The topic of the debate was "<a href="http://bartdehrman.com/engagements.htm">Is the Text of the New Testament Reliable?</a>" or, as per White's website, "<a href="http://www.sovereigncruises.org/AO2009/debate.htm">Does the Bible Misquote Jesus?</a>" In any case, the purpose of the debate was to discuss the textual reliability of the New Testament writings. </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Although we have not yet seen the debate and cannot, naturally, comment upon the performance of the debaters, we are prompted, however, to respond to some comments made by James White, who recently <a href="http://www.aomin.org/aoblog/index.php?itemid=3092"><span style="COLOR: #3333ff">wrote</span></a>:</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in"><i><span lang="EN-GB">"I was especially interested in his tremendous fear to even talk about the Qur'an and Islam. I thought Dr. Ehrman is a professor of religious studies? The chair of that department, in fact? Yet he professed <em>utter</em></span></i><em><span style="FONT-STYLE: normal" lang="EN-GB"> ignorance</span></em><i><span lang="EN-GB"> of Islam last night, once even accusing me of trying to "liken" him to a Muslim! He simply <em>refused</em> to comment on the Qur'an whatsoever, not even theoretically answering the question that if the Qur'an has textual variants, would this not mean that the Qur'an is misquoting Muhammad? His unwillingness to apply his own hyper-skepticism to anything other than Christianity betrays his deep bias and prejudice. He knew that to be consistent he would have to say the Qur'an misquotes Muhammad, but Dr. Ehrman is a good post-modernist liberal, and quite politically correct. He avoided that like the plague, though, obviously, he would have to say that very thing, if he was consistent."</span></i></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">First, why is the Quran being dragged into a discussion having ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with its textual transmission? What is the point? The topic of the debate is the New Testament and <b>not</b> the Quran. </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">For arguments sake, let us suppose that the Quran has textual variants. How on earth is that relevant in a discussion pertaining to the textual transmission and preservation of the <b>New Testament?</b> Why would White go out of his way and demand his opponent, who does not even happen to be a Muslim and who honestly professes his ignorance on Quranic and Islamic studies, to comment upon the Quran and Islam? That the Quran has textual variants has no bearing upon the topic of the debate and does nothing to 'refute' any argument presented by Ehrman against the textual reliability of the New Testament writings. </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Therefore, it is completely out of order to drag in the Quran one way or the other in a debate on the textual preservation of the <b>New Testament</b>. Bringing in the Quran in a debate having nothing to do with it was even more bizarre considering the fact that White's opponent was <b>an agnostic and not a Muslim</b>!</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Secondly, White's desperation is clear when he thoughtlessly attributes Ehrman's very reasonable refusal to comment upon the Quran to the latter's alleged 'tremendous fear'. It is as if in the world of James White there can be no legitimate reason, other than one being in 'tremendous fear', to decline discussing the Quran. He produces no argument and no evidence whatsoever to support the assertion that Ehrman refused to comment upon the Quran due to being in 'tremendous fear'. It does not take a genius to see through White's psychological game. He is employing a sorry little rhetorical tactic of utilising <i>buzzwords</i>, or <i>scare words</i>, such as 'tremendous fear', to garner the support of his like-minded evangelical fan-base and for the negative anti-Muslim connotation/picture it evokes in the minds of many non-Muslims. The buzzword or the loaded terminology of 'tremendous fear', with all its rhetorical power, is used to manipulate the readers' sympathies in order to influence opinion against Ehrman. The use of such overtly loaded terminology serves the purpose of merely swaying the emotions of the readers. Rather than present an argument, the overtones of the emotionally loaded words are meant to 'do all the work'.&nbsp; Poor debaters often employ this discredited rhetorical ploy to compensate for their low argumentation skills.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">We need to ask, why on earth is it 'confusing' or 'nonsensical' to conclude that Ehrman, quite rightly, did not comment upon the Quran because <b>1)</b> the subject of the debate was the New Testament and not the Quran; <b>2)</b> Ehrman is not a scholar/expert on Quranic studies? On what basis are these two possibilities to be dismissed <i>a priori</i> in favour of White's 'tremendous fear' hypothesis? What makes more sense, particularly in light of Ehrman's own reasoning as summarised by White, "<i>he professed <em>utter ignorance</em> of Islam last night, once even accusing me of trying to "liken" him to a Muslim!</i>"? Does it seem sensible to dismiss Ehrman's own stated reasoning for the one conjured up by White? This can only be done if White can prove to his readers that he has the ability to go inside Ehrman's mind and extract the latter's 'real' reasons for not commenting upon the Quran and Islam.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Third, White writes:</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in"><i><span lang="EN-GB">I thought Dr. Ehrman is a professor of religious studies? The chair of that department, in fact? Yet he professed <em>utter ignorance</em> of Islam last night, once even accusing me of trying to "liken" him to a Muslim! He simply <em>refused</em> to comment on the Qur'an whatsoever, not even theoretically answering the question</span></i></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Is Ehrman supposed to be an expert on <i>every</i> religion existing on our good planet Earth because he happens to be '<i>a professor of religious studies</i>' and '<i>the chair of that department</i>'? Is this really what White wants us to believe? Do note that the above is his 'counter response' to Ehrman's refusal to comment upon Islam and the Quran. </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Since White is seemingly quite confused, we should break it out to him that Ehrman is a <b>professor of New Testament studies</b> and one who happens to be the head of the religious studies department at the same time. Being the head of the religious studies department does not mean that Ehrman, or any other individual, is thus <i>also</i> an expert on <i>all</i> religions being taught in that department, let alone all religions on Earth. It is not a pre-requisite for the head of the religious studies department in a university to have expert knowledge about <i>all</i> religions. The New Testament, as Ehrman himself states, is his area of expertise; NOT ISLAM. Why can't White get this simple point?</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">We strongly suspect that White desperately required Ehrman to utter certain desired comments about Islam and the Quran so that he could later employ those words against Muslims who made use of Ehrman's scholarship, arguing along the lines of, '<i>but look, here is what Ehrman says about the Quran!</i>' But, being a sober minded scholar, Ehrman did not comment upon the Quran since, as he admits, he is not an authority on Quranic and Islamic studies. This has, quite understandably, immensely upset White and made him frustrated. How dare Ehrman rob him of an opportunity of hitting back at those 'tremendously scary Muslims' who use Ehrman's writings and are bent on world conquest?</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Being apparently unfamiliar with critical thinking, it did not occur to White that even if in the event he had succeeded in making Ehrman say what he wanted him to say regarding the Quran's textual integrity, it would simply not have meant that Muslims were then obliged to accept Ehrman's comments about the Quran. It could be that Ehrman is right about the New Testament, being an authority on it, but wrong about the Quran. Just because Ehrman has something to say about the New Testament, it does not follow that whatever he says about the Quran 'must' be accepted or automatically becomes 'right'. All assertions and arguments need to be critically examined on a case by case basis.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Another&nbsp;comment we take objection with&nbsp;is White's, '<i>to be consistent he would have to say the Qur'an misquotes Muhammad.,</i>' Now suppose Ehrman had said precisely this. The question then is <i>SO WHAT?</i> How does this 'engage' or 'debunk' anything Ehrman has said about the text and manuscripts of the New Testament? This is NOT how scholarship works. Every document is to be studied on the basis of its own evidence, within its environment, and taking into account its own unique circumstances/data. So just because we may conclude, on the basis of evidence, that we do not have the 'original' text of the New Testament or that the Bible 'misquotes' Jesus, it does not follow that we are now 'required' to say the same about the Quran for the sake of being 'consistent'! It could also be that a critical investigation of the evidence and the data pertaining to the Quran would lead an objective investigator to conclude that, in contrast to the Bible, the Quranic text is preserved and, therefore, Muhammad (peace be upon him) is not 'misquoted' therein (Of course, for Muslims, since it is not said nor believed that Muhammad's (peace be upon him) words are present within the Quran to begin with, the notion of 'misquoting Muhammad' naturally does not even arise!). It could also be that a particular variant is shown to be blatantly secondary, one which is unique to a particular manuscript, say an unintentional scribal error, and one which did not enter nor alter the transmission of the Quranic text. These real possibilities exist, including the possibility of an investigator reaching White's own desired conclusion pertaining to the Quranic text. The point here is that a discussion on the Bible tells us nothing about any aspect of the Quran (and vice versa). Both need to be studied individually based on their surrounding evidence.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">White's&nbsp;inconsistency can also be seen in his allegation that it was because of '<i>deep bias and prejudice'</i> that Ehrman did not comment upon the Quran and Islam, as if White, <b>an evangelical apologist and polemicist</b>, is deeply unbiased and unprejudiced when he regularly attacks Islam, uses shoddy online polemical Christian writings to question the Quran's textual integrity, and when he engages in spreading stereotypical and generalized views of Muslims! On top of that, we are now to believe that an <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">AGNOSTIC</b> refused to comment upon the Quran due to 'deep bias and prejudice'! But more importantly, White is in denial when it comes to accepting Ehrman's own very reasonable stated reason for not commenting upon the Quran and Islam (see above) in a debate HAVING NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO with the Quran and Islam. In response to White's <i>ad hominem</i> attack, this is NOT about being '<i>a good post-modernist liberal',</i> it is simply about being scholarly and commenting only upon the <b>relevant</b> subjects and subjects on which one has the <b>authority/qualifications</b> to speak, a simple concept alien to a rabid polemicist such as White.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Moving on, White also writes: </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in"><i><span lang="EN-GB">"One other item. Ehrman asked me to cite all 12 papyri manuscripts that can be dated to within 100 years of the writing of the New Testament. I knew where my list was in a print book, but forgot totally that I had the same book in my Libronix library! I could have pulled the list in 20 seconds had I remembered that. I have been kicking myself for that all morning once I realized how quickly I could have accessed the information. But, here's the data (I will be expanding this discussion a good bit in the future). The following manuscripts have been dated to the second century by credible papyrologists and paleographers: P4/P64/P67 (all one manuscript), P32 (which I mentioned), P46, P52, P66, P75, P77, P87, P90, P98, P104, P108, P109."</span></i></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Ehrman was absolutely right in challenging White to mention the 12 papyri manuscripts 'dated' to 'within 100 years' of the writing of the 'New Testament'. White's excuse that he knew where the list was in a printed book and that he '<i>forgot totally I had the same book in my Libronix library!</i>' is just a sad little excuse to say the least.&nbsp; Why could he not simply name these 12 papyri manuscripts 'dated' to 'within 100 years' of the writing of the New Testament when challenged? How could it be that he simply found it astonishingly impossible to memorise their papyrus numbers? A'scholar who is supposed to have spent a good many years of his life studying the New Testament textual criticism is at the very least to be expected to have known the names of at least the most important earliest manuscripts!</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The entire way White has framed the discussion is faulty, simplistic, and conveys a highly misleading impression of the state of the earliest manuscripts of the New Testament.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">First, there is a <b>big difference</b> between the assertion that there are 12 papyri manuscripts '<i>dated to <b>within</b> 100 years of the writing of the New Testament</i>' and the assertion that there are papyri manuscripts '<i>dated to the second century</i>.' These two assertions are NOT one and the same. What if a manuscript is placed in the late second century and is still removed from the writing of the original by over 100 years? White does not take into account this real possibility (actually a fact as we shall see below).</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">What precisely does White mean when he says that there are 12 papyri manuscripts '<i>dated to <b>within</b> 100 years of the writing of the New Testament</i>'? Does he mean:</span></p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">We can do a simple exercise of considering the gap between all of the New Testament writings and their earliest manuscript. We will define 'c. 200' as being anywhere within 170-225 A.D and 'late second century' as 170 A.D. Not only can we not be entirely certain when a particular manuscript was written, another problem whilst working out the gap is that we do not know when precisely a number of New Testament documents were composed. Taking the lower and higher composition dates will either increase or decrease the gap between the original and its earliest manuscript. In most instances we will, therefore, be using the most widely accepted dates and in some instances we will take into account the latest possible composition dates.</span></p>

This falsifies White's boast that there are '<i>papyri manuscripts that can be dated to within 100 years of the writing of the New Testament</i>'. The time gap for the Pauline writings is considerable. Paul wrote sometime in the 40's and 50's and the earliest fragmentary witnesses of his letters appear from c. 200, thereby giving us easily 100+ years gap between the writing of Paul's epistles and their earliest extant manuscript. Matthew and Luke, on the other hand, appear for the first time in fragments in c. 200. The earliest fragment of Revelation is p98, late second (or early third) century, containing only part of chapter 1 verses 13-20. The earliest fragment of Hebrew is p46, c. 200. Another early fragment of Hebrew is p12, dated late third century, containing Hebrews 1:1. </span></p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">White's assertion definitely holds true only for the gospel of John, the tiny fragment p52 being its earliest witness, as well as the other second century fragment p90. The gap could be brought down to within hundred years in the case of Matthew, Luke and Hebrews - provided we consider the latest composition dates and grant the earliest possible dates to their respective manuscripts. The gap between the earliest manuscript and the original document may be more realistically brought down to within hundred years when it comes to Revelation and Titus. But for the vast majority of the New Testament writings, the manuscript evidence begins to surface sometime <b><i>after</i></b> 100 years of their writing. </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">To assert that there are '<i>12 papyri manuscripts dated to within 100 years of the writing of the New Testament</i>' can be highly misleading as it gives the impression as if there are manuscripts for <i>all</i> the separate New Testament writings dated to within hundred years of their composition. White should have clarified that these 12 papyri manuscripts do not contain the entire New Testament and, moreover, the manuscripts of most New Testament writings are separated from their originals by <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">over</i> 100 years.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">From the first Christian century the manuscript evidence is completely lacking. From the first half of the second century we have small fragments from the gospel of John. Substantial manuscript evidence begins to surface only from <i>c.</i> 200 onwards and even then a number of New Testament writings are completely absent in these c. 200 witnesses.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Based on the above brief discussion, it comes as no surprise that Ehrman, an informed textual critic, challenged White "<i>to cite all 12 papyri manuscripts that can be dated to within 100 years of the writing of the New Testament.</i>"</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><b><u><span style="COLOR: blue" lang="EN-GB">B) There are 12 papyri manuscripts which date from within 100 years of the writing of the <i>last</i> New Testament writing</span></u></b></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Did White mean to suggest that there are 12 papyri manuscripts which date from within 100 years of the writing of the <b><i>last</i></b> New Testament writing? If so, then this is a strange line of reasoning indeed. To begin with, is Revelation to be deemed the 'last' writing for appearing chronologically at the very end of the New Testament? Or is II Peter to be deemed as the <i>last</i> writing of the New Testament for being regarded by the consensus of New Testament scholars to be the latest writing to be composed within the canon (thought to be written by most in the late first, with many even suggesting it could have been composed up to the first three decades of the second century)?</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">If Revelation was composed, at the latest, by A.D. 96, then its earliest witness appears sometime in the late second century (p98.). This fragment, containing only part of Chapter 1 verses 13-20, does indeed fall within a 100 year period after the writing of Revelation. But besides lacking much of Revelation, also absent within it are all the remainder of the New Testament writings. And, moreover, it is separated by Mark and the Pauline epistles by over 100 years. Therefore, it still remains that White conveys a very misleading impression when he proudly boasts that there are '<i>12 papyri manuscripts that can be dated to within 100 years of the writing of the New Testament.</i>' </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">If White meant II Peter, the problem still remains. The earliest witness of II Peter is p72, from the late third or early fourth century. Whether we consider II Peter's latest possible date (say, around 135 A.D) or the earliest possible date (around 65 A.D), it remains that we have easily a 100+ year gap between the earliest witness and the date of II Peter's composition (not to mention the gap between p72 and all remaining New Testament writings).</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">So then, it is just a bizarre type of argument (and factually false when it comes to II Peter and p72), to say the least, if White meant to say that there are 12 papyri manuscripts which date from within 100 years of the writing of the <b><i>last</i></b> New Testament writing.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">White may dismiss the above and claim that what he actually meant to say was simply that <i>other</i> manuscripts of the New Testament exist from within 100 years of the writing of the last New Testament document (be it Revelation or II Peter). If so, this would be a meaningless argument. So what if p52, the earliest fragment of the <b>gospel of John</b>, falls within 100 years after the composition of both Revelation and/or II Peter, the texts of which it <strong>completely lacks</strong>?<span style="COLOR: black"> So what if, for example, p66, p32 or any other papyri placed around c. 200 or close to the third century, is separated by less than a 100 year gap from the writing of Revelation and II Peter when these papyri do not even contain the texts of these documents?! </span></span></p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="COLOR: black" lang="EN-GB">What matters is <b>not</b> the gap between a document and the earliest manuscript of <i>another</i> document, but the gap between a document and only <i><u>its</u></i> earliest witness.</span></p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 1in"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">[there are] . <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">12 papyri manuscripts that can be dated to within 100 years of the writing of the New Testament</i></font></font></span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The above hides the fact that for most New Testament writings the gap between the original and the earliest manuscript is over 100 years. Moreover, that it is pointless to consider the gap between a document and the manuscript of <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">another</i></b> document. This is commonsense.</font></span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">At most, Wallace proceeds to claim that '<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">over 40 percent of all the verses in the New Testament are already found in the manuscripts within a century of the completion of the New Testament.</i>' - Time slice: 19:29 - 19:38</font></span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The '40 percent' could be from within 100 years from the 'last' New Testament writing (be it Revelation or II Peter), or from within 100 years of the 'completion' of the New Testament, but still be separated (most of it at least) from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">their own</i> originals by over 100 years. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Thus the problem remains the same: Wallace's assertion cleverly masks the fact that the gap between most New Testament writings and their earliest manuscripts is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">over</i> 100 years. </font></span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in"><span style="COLOR: black" lang="EN-GB"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Wallace's assertion would only hold water if these 'over 40 percent' of the New Testament verses <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">belong to manuscripts separated by their own originals by less than 100 years.</i> </font></span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">At most, manuscripts of two different documents may only be compared in order to study scribal copying practises and to compare the way two related documents were transmitted.</font></span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span lang="EN-GB">6. </span></b><span lang="EN-GB">According to White: '<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">everybody knows that when you look at the dating of manuscripts that you are given a range and that different scholars will have a different range so often you take what is in essence a 50 year range.</i>' Yes, 'everybody' knows this just as everybody also knows that we do not just take the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">earliest</i> '<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">possible</i>' date for a manuscript in order to narrow down the gap between a document and its earliest manuscript to 'within 100 years'. It is a wise and established historical practice to consider later, though reasonably later, dates. P46 is placed by almost all scholars to the 'late second century' or 'about c. 200' period (and even to the third century, for example: <strong>Leon Vaganay, Christian-Bernard Amphoux, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">An Introduction to New Testament textual criticism</i>, Second Edition Revised &amp; Updated, 1991, Cambridge University Press, p. 11; Helmut Koester, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">An Introduction To The New Testament: History And Literature Of Early Christianity</i>, Vol. 2, 1987, Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co., p. 22</strong>). While it <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">could have</i> been written at precisely 150 A.D., thereby reducing the gap between the Pauline epistles (parts of Romans, 1 &amp; 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 Thessalonians) and p46 to exactly 100 years, or just around it, or barely within it, it is much safer and more reasonable to place p46 in the later period, which thereby gives us a gap of over 100 years. But even putting aside p46, what are we to do regarding the over 100 years gap between p72 and I/II Peter/Jude, between Mark and p45, between Acts and p38, Philemon and p87, II Thessalonians and p92, I, II Timothy, 3 John and codex Sinaiticus, James and p23 &amp; p20, 2 John and 0232? How does White propose to lower the time gaps to 'within' 100 years for these writings?</span></font></font></p>
