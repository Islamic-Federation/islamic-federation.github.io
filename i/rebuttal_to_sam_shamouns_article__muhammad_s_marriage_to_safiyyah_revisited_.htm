<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>Let's start with the first one:<SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"><FONT face="Times New Roman"></FONT></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=4><B><U>Refuting Shamoun's section on "Banu al-Mustaliq: Oppressors or Oppressed?"</U></B><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>There is really nothing much to refute here. Shamoun just basically puts forth several hadith that show that the Muslims attacked the Bani Mustaliq by catching them off guard. The Bani Mustaliq were surprised and unaware of the attack by the Muslims.&nbsp; Then</FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>Shamoun says:<SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3><I>It is hard to accept that Banu al-Mustaliq posed a threat to the Muslims in light of the fact that when Muhammad's band of thugs came upon them they were busy tending their flocks! One would think that the Banu al-Mustaliq would be readying themselves for battle and arming their men with weapons if the Muslim assertion was true.</I><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>I'll ignore Shamoun's cheap shot of throwing the term "thugs" at the companions and just get to the point.&nbsp;<SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>Shamoun basically did not even address the narrations that I have put forth previously which state that the Bani Mustaliq were preparing for a war against the Muslims.&nbsp;<SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>Secondly, he quotes Imam Nawawis commentary on Sahih Muslim:<SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3><I>2220. According to Imam Nawawi, this hadith shows that those unbelievers who have received the message of Islam <B>can be attacked UNAWARE if the need so arises</B>. The correct view is that those who have not received the message of Islam, it is essential to give them the Divine Message before giving them the ultimatum of war, but for those who have received this message, it is desirable to inform them before entering the battle. Exception can, however, be made in this case, when there is a dire necessity (Vol. II, p. 81). (Sahih Muslim by Imam Muslim, Rendered into English by Abdul Hamid Siddiqi [Kitab Bhavan, New Delhi, India, 11<SUP>th</SUP> reprinted 1995], Volume III &amp; IV, Kitab Al-Jihad Wa'l-Siyar (The Book of Jihad and Expedition), Chapter DCCIV: Regarding Permission To Make A Raid, Without An Ultimatum, Upon The Disbelievers Who Have Already Been Invited Accept Islam, p. 942, fn. 2220; bold, capital and italic emphasis ours)</I><I><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"></SPAN></I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>Notice that Imam Nawawi said that the unbelievers won't be attacked unaware UNLESS THE NEED SO ARISES. So what was the need in this specific case? Well due to the narrations I put forth (which Shamoun didn't address), it was because the Bani Mustaliq were preparing for war and the Muslims had to ensure that they didn't sit around getting the first blow.&nbsp;<SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>Thirdly, just because the Muslims had attacked the Bani Mustaliq while they were unaware, that doesn't mean that the Muslims initiated the problem. It does not need a rocket scientist to figure out how to reconcile these narrations. Here is what most likely happened:<SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>The Bani Mustaliq were preparing to launch an attack on the Muslims. The Muslims had foreknowledge about this, therefore they took the initiative and attacked first. The Bani Mustaliq were not aware that the Muslims knew about their preparation for war, therefore they were surprised as to why the Muslims attacked them.<SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>Simple as that. That is what most likely happened if we were to be consistent and accept all the narrations regarding this event. Shamoun is saying that they shouldn't have been attending to their livestock if they were preparing for war. Well isn't it possible that SOME of the tribe were attending to the livestock and not ALL of them? It does not need a rocket scientist to try and guess the details.&nbsp;<SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>Shamoun continues on to say:<SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3><I>A careful examination of the Islamic sources reveals that the Arab tribes, specifically the Meccans, were fed up with Muhammad's threats and hostile attitude towards them.</I><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>I am very unimpressed with Shamoun's ignorance taking into consideration that he writes articles on comparative religion on a full time basis. Anyone who reads history knows that the Meccans oppressed the Muslims and drove them out. That they had a huge bounty on the Prophet's head. Shamoun also argued the same thing regarding the Jews. Again, this is Shamoun's ignorance. Anyone who reads history would know that when the Muslims went to Medinah, they immediately signed a peace treaty with the Jews. But it was the Jews who broke the treaties and betrayed the Muslims.&nbsp;<SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>Shamoun says:<SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3><I>This is precisely why the Jewish tribes rejected Muhammad since they knew from their Scriptures that the true God that spoke to Abraham and Moses didn't commission him to be his spokesperson.</I><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>Would Shamoun also like to appeal to the Jews knowledge of their scripture when they rejected Jesus' Prophethood?<SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3><I>And so it happened. After three years of constant struggle, a relative of his, called Khawla, went to him and pointed out that his house was sadly neglected and that his daughters needed a mother to look after them. "But who can take the place of Khadijah?" he asked. "Aisha, the daughter of Abu Bakr, the dearest of people to you," she answered. Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) had been the first man to accept Islam and he was the Prophet's closest companion. Like Khadijah, he had done all that he could do to help the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and had spent all his wealth in the way of Allah. However, while the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was now fifty-three years old, Aisha as only a little girl of seven. <B><U>She was hardly in a position to look after either the Prophet's household or children</U></B>. "She is very young." Replied the Prophet. <B><U>Khawla had a solution for everything. She suggested that he marry at the same time a lady called Sawda</U></B>, the widow of Al-Sakran ibn 'Amr.

The reason why the Prophet (peace be upon him) specifically chose Sawda is because he saw the love that she had for Islam.

<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3><I><SPAN style="COLOR: red">So even according to Sam we cannot be sure about what truly did happen.

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>I even reiterated my position in the conclusion of my second rebuttal to Shamoun:<SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>So I did acknowledge the unreliability of the reports. However, I just quoted back Tabari against Shamoun because the very source he quoted refuted him. That does not mean that I believed in its reliability or tried to show that I did. But again, since Shamoun can't read my articles properly (he accuses me of doing so with his articles) he went ahead and misrepresented my position to the readers.&nbsp;<SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>It's interesting how Shamoun changes the perspective of his argument. In his first article he gave the impression that the reason why the Prophet's wives didn't leave was because they would have been executed as apostates. So Shamoun was giving the impression that the Prophet's wives really hated Islam deep down in their hearts but pretended to be good Muslims in order to stay alive. And now he is arguing that the Prophet's wives really were believers and the reason why they didn't leave the Prophet was because they feared hell.&nbsp;<SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>Shamoun says:<SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>Yes but the law for killing apostates would have come later.

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>If I were to do so, I could write over a dozen pages showing narrations in which the Prophet's wives were pleased in their marriage and were happy with Islam even after the Prophet's death. I challenge Shamoun to show otherwise. I challenge Shamoun to show evidence that the wives wished that they had divorced the Prophet or were displeased in their marriage to him. It is all assumptions and mind games by Shamoun. That's all. Means absolutely nothing.&nbsp;<SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
