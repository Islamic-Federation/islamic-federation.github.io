The Prophet (peace be upon him) never uttered those verses. To sum it all up, the story basically states that when the Prophet (peace be upon him) was leading the prayer one time near the Ka&#39;bah, he was reciting Surah 53:19-20 and then immediately after he recited those verses, he said &quot;those are the high-flying cranes and indeed their intercession is to be hoped for&quot; so the Quraysh tribe were so thrilled that the Prophet (peace be upon him) spoke so positively about their Gods that they also prostrated with the Muslims after he recited those verses. Afterwards, Allah sent down a verse rebuking the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) (Surah 17:73-75) and also sent down a verse abrogating the &quot;Satanic Revelation&quot; (Surah 22:52).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Then, when in the Ramadan of the same year this incident took place the news spread that the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had recited Surah An-Najm publicly in the assembly of the Quraish and the whole assembly, including the believers as well as the disbelievers, had fallen down in prostration with him. When the emigrants to Abyssinia heard this news they formed the impression that the disbelievers of Makkah had become Muslims. Thereupon, some of them returned to Makkah in the Shawwal of the 5th year of Prophethood, only to learn that the news was wrong and the conflict between Islam and disbelief was raging as furiously as before. Consequently, the second emigration to Abyssinia took place, in which many more people left Makkah.</span></span></span></p>

Allah&#39;s Messenger proceeded with his recitation until the end of the Sura, at which point he prostrated, and the Muslims prostrated with him as well as all those of the pagans that were in the mosque. There remained no-one in the mosque, neither believer nor non-believer, except he prostrated, but for al-Walid ibn al-Mughira and Abu Uhayha Sa`id ibn al-`As who took a handful of earth and applied it to their foreheads, prostrating on it, for they were aged old men who could not prostrate. Then the Quraysh dispersed in elation at the way they had heard their gods mentioned, saying: &quot;Muhammad has mentioned our gods in the best way possible.&quot; They also said: &quot;We definitely know that Allah gives life and gives death as well as creates and sustains, but these our gods intercede for us before Him, so if Muhammad gives them their share, we are with him.&quot; When evening came, Gibril came to Allah&#39;s Messenger - Allah bless and greet him - and said: &quot;O Muhammad! What have you done? You have recited to the people something which I never brought you from Allah Exalted and Almighty.&quot; Hearing this, the Prophet - Allah bless and greet him - was deeply grieved and feared much from Allah (swt). So Allah revealed to him the following verse in which he consoled him , as He was ever merciful towards him:</span> </span></span></p>

But when they neared Mecca the news reached them that what they had heard of the Islam of the Meccans was false. So no-one actually entered Mecca except under protection or stealthily. When the above verse was revealed, the Quraysh said: &quot;Muhammad regrets his words about the status of our gods before Allah and has now changed them.&quot; The two phrases that the devil had interjected upon the tongue of Allah&#39;s Messenger - Allah bless and greet him - by then were in the mouth of every idolater, and their hostility increased in intensity against those who had accepted Islam.</span> </span></span></p>

However, the profusion of the chains show that the story has a basis, furthermore, there are two other &quot;mursal&quot; chains whose narrators are those of Bukhari and Muslim. The first one is that narrated by al-Tabari through Yunus ibn Yazid from Ibn Shihab [al-Zuhri]: &quot;Abu Bakr ibn `Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Harith ibn Hisham narrated to me,&quot; etc. The second is what al-Tabari also narrated through al-Mu`tamir ibn Sulayman and Hammad ibn Salama from Dawud ibn Abi Hind from Abu al-`Aliya.... Contrary to what Abu Bakr ibn al-`Arabi and al-Qadi `Iyad have claimed whereby the story has no basis at all.... When the paths of a hadith are many and distinct, it shows that the report has a basis.... So, as I said, there are three sound but &#39;mursal&#39; chains for it, among them what meets the criteria of the two Sahihs but for the fact that they are &#39;mursal&#39;.

To this position leaned Ibn al-Baqillani. It was also said that when he reached the words { Have ye thought upon Al Lat and Al Uzza? And Manat, the third, the other?} the pagans feared lest he would add something to mock their gods, so they hastened to interject and jeer so as to cover up what was coming next, as was their habit stated in the verse { Those who disbelieve say: Heed not this Quran, and drown the hearing of it; haply ye may conquer} (41:26). This act on their part was attributed to the devil as it was he that inspired it to them. Or, what was meant by the devil was the devil of humankind.... It was also said that the Prophet - Allah bless and greet him used to recite the Qur&#39;an slowly, so that the devil lay in wait for one of the pauses and uttered the words in question with the same timbre of voice. Those that were near him heard it as if coming from the Prophet - Allah bless and greet him - and attributed it to him. This is the best of all interpretations.&quot;</span> </span></span></p>

The meaning of &#39;<i>amaniyya</i>&#39; in the verse being: &#39;recitation&#39;. Allah Almighty therefore informed us in this verse that His way with His Messengers is that when they say something, Satan adds something to it on his part. This is an explicit proof-text that it is Satan that conveys this statement inside the Prophet&#39;s words - Allah bless and greet him - and it is not the latter that says it.

Whereupon `Umar came in to see Hafsa while Asma&#39; was with her. He asked who she was and Hafsa told him. `Umar said: She is the Abyssinian? The one from accross the sea? Asma&#39; said yes. `Umar said: We all [emigrants to Madina] made Hijra before you all [emigrants to Abyssinia], so we are more entitled to the Messenger of Allah than you - Allah bless and greet him. She became angry and said: Not at all, by Allah! You were with the Messenger of Allah - Allah bless and greet him - at a time he fed your hungry ones and admonished your ignorant ones, while we were in the abode of alienation and detestation (dar al-bu`ada&#39; wa al-bughada&#39;) in Abyssinia, all for the sake of Allah and for the sake of Rasulullah! And, by Allah, I shall not eat one morsel of food nor drink one drop of water until I mention what you said to Rasulullah! And how much did we suffer, and how we lived in fear! But I shall mention this to the Prophet! Etc.&quot;</span> </span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0in; margin-left:0in"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:red">- All the above does not preclude the fact that the Meccan unbelievers did prostrate upon hearing Sura al-Najm exactly as it was revealed, due to its majesty and the fear caused in them by the invocation of punishment pronounced towards its end. One needs only to imagine them gathered together with the Muslims before the Ka`ba as the Prophet - Allah bless and greet him - himself recited this newly-revealed Sura to them from beginning to end. Similar examples are the reactions of the unbelievers at the invocations of punishment they heard from the believers. For example, `Utba ibn Rabi`a&#39;s reaction when he heard the verse { If they turn away, tell them I have warned you of a destruction similar to that of `Ad and Thamud} (Fussilat 13). Upon hearing this `Utba placed his hand on the mouth of the Prophet - Allah bless and greet him - so that the threat of punishment would be averted. And when Khubayb ibn `Adi pronounced a similar threat, Abu Sufyan lied down on the ground together with his son Mu`awiya to deflect its harm.</span> </span></span></p>

This is the same man who used to sit in the Haram of Madina attacking the Awliya and Sufis, and who wrote that the father and mother of the Prophet - Allah bless and greet him - are in Hellfire.

This in no way disproves the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him). It actually does nothing but convince me even more that he truly was a Prophet from God! The funny thing is that if the Quran was truly authored by Satan as many critics claim&nbsp;then why on earth would Satan abrogate the &#39;satanic revelations&#39; of Surah 53 and then expose himself? If the Quran is truly inspired by Satan then Satan should have just let people believe in that Satanic revelation. If the Quran is truly authored by Satan then why would Satan only bother to expose himself on that specific verse? The truth of the matter is that this is absolute nonsense. If we want to accept the story we could only accept this conclusion:&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0in; margin-left:0in"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><strong><span style="color:#336666">Satan deceived the Prophet (peace be upon him) for those few seconds by whispering those verses into him and tricking him into saying it. However later on God protected His Prophet (peace be upon him) and rebuked Satan and exposed Satan&#39;s failure in his attempt to bring people into idol worship. This could only show that the author of the Quran truly is God and no one else! </span></strong></span></span></p>
