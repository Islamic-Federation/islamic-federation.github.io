Details of his unreliability as a narrator would probably fill several pages</b>, but all of it may be suitably condensed into a statement by Imam ash-Shafi'ee, who was his contemporary, and who knew him personally. Ash-Shafi'ee has the following to say: &quot;In Madeenah there were seven people who used to forge chains of narration. One of them was al-Waqidi.&quot;<sup>3</sup> (Sources: </font><a href="http://www.allaahuakbar.net/shiites/vicious_unscrupulous_propaganda_of_shiia-2.htm%22"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">http://www.allaahuakbar.net/shiites/vicious_unscrupulous_propaganda_of_shiia-2.htm</font></a><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> and </font><a href="http://www.ansar.org/english/hasan.htm"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">http://www.ansar.org/english/hasan.htm</font></a><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">; bold emphasis ours) </font></font></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1in"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Al-Waqidi (130/747-207/822-23), who wrote over twenty works of an historical nature, but only the Kitab al-Maghazi has survived as an independent work. His reputation is marred by the fact that he relied upon story tellers; viz., those who embellished the stories of others. Al-Waqidi did such embellish, such as by adding dates and other details onto the account of Ibn Ishaq (at pages 25-29) (</font><a href="http://jeromekahn123.tripod.com/enlightenment/id3.html"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">http://jeromekahn123.tripod.com/enlightenment/id3.html</font></a><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">) </font></font></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1in"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">... The chain of the narrators is not reliable because the person who narrated to Ibn Sa'd was Waqidi WHO IS NOTORIOUS AS A NARRATOR OF FABRICATED <i>hadithes</i>. The next one Ya'qub is unknown and 'Abd Allah Ibn 'Abd al-Rahman is not a Companion. Consequently this narration is not trustworthy. (Ibn Sa'd's <i>Kitab Al-Tabaqat Al-Kabir</i>, Volume I, English translation by S. Moinul Haq, M.A., PH.D assisted by H.K.

The most amazing part of this is that the authors' friend, MENJ has a response <u>on the same web site where this rebuttal appears</u> from G.F. Haddad seeking to deny the historicity of the Satanic Verses where he calls into question al-Waqidi's reliability! Here is what Haddad says about al-Waqidi: </font></font></p>

Waraqa said, &quot;This is the same Namus (i.e., Gabriel, the Angel who keeps the secrets) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn you out.&quot; Allah's Apostle asked, &quot;Will they turn me out?&quot; Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said: &quot;Never did a man come with something similar to what you have brought but was treated with hostility. If I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you strongly.&quot; But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was also paused for a while and the Prophet (peace be upon him) became so sad <b><u>as we have heard that he intended several times to throw himself from the tops of high mountains and every time he went up the top of a mountain in order to throw himself down, </u></b>Gabriel would appear before him and say, &quot;O Muhammad! You are indeed Allah's Apostle in truth&quot; whereupon his heart would become quiet and he would calm down and would return home. And whenever the period of the coming of the inspiration used to become long, he would do as before, but when he used to reach the top of a mountain, Gabriel would appear before him and say to him what he had said before. (Ibn 'Abbas said regarding the meaning of: 'He it is that Cleaves the daybreak (from the darkness)' (6.96) that Al-Asbah. means the light of the sun during the day and the light of the moon at night). </font></font></p>

I looked up and saw Gabriel in it. He called me saying, 'Allah has heard your people's saying to you, and what they have replied back to you, Allah has sent the Angel of the Mountains to you so that you may order him to do whatever you wish to these people.' The Angel of the Mountains called and greeted me, and then said, &quot;O Muhammad! Order what you wish. If you like, I will let Al-Akh-Shabain (i.e. two mountains) fall on them.&quot; The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, &quot;No but I hope that Allah will let them beget children who will worship Allah Alone, and will worship None besides Him.&quot; </font></font></p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: auto 0in; BACKGROUND: white" class="ecmsonormal"><span style="COLOR: black">Here we see that the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated that the worst trouble or depression that he had ever undergone was during the time he went to the city of Taif and was rejected by the people. Yet, nowhere do we see that he tried to commit suicide after this incident. Therefore, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) to have attempted to commit suicide in the previous incident would have to mean that he was more depressed than he was after his trip to Taif. However, we see that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said that he was most depressed at this incident. This causes us to doubt the Bukhari narration even more.&nbsp; </span></p>

There is a gap in the chain of transmission between Aisha and Imam Zuhri, thus we don't know if the missing link in the chain is a reliable narrator or not.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Shaykh GF Haddad said:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="#ff0000" size="3" face="Times New Roman">This conclusion [that Bukhari is 100% authentic] excludes the chainless, broken-chained reports, or unattributed reports sometimes adduced by al-Bukhari in his chapter-titles or appended to certain narrations. <u><b>An example of the latter is the so-called &quot;suicide hadith&quot;&nbsp;- one of al-Zuhri's unattributive narrations (balaghat) which is actually broken-chained and therefore weak. It does not meet the criteria of hadith authenticity used by the lesser and greater hadith Masters, much less that of al-Bukhari </b></u>who mentioned it only to show its discrepancy with two other chains whose versions omit the attempted suicide story, and Allah knows best.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#ff0000">The above conclusion is proof that the position that everything that is found in the two Sahihs is rigorously sound refers only to full-chained reports positively attributed to the Prophet Muhammad. </font><b><font color="#000000">(<a href="http://www.livingislam.org/k/whb_e.html">Source</a>)</font></b></font></font></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="COLOR: red">Muhammad expected the revelations to guide his path from day to day, but they subsided. Gabriel did not appear for some time, and all around him there was nothing but silence. Muhammad fell into solitude, separated from himself as well as from the people. His old fears recurred. It is told that even Khadijah said to him, &quot;Does it not seem that your Lord is displeased with you?&quot; Dismayed and frightened, he returned to the mountain and the cave of Hira'. There, he prayed for God fervently, seeking assiduously to reach Him. Particularly, he wanted to ask God about the cause of this divine displeasure. Khadijah did not dread these days any less than Muhammad, nor was she any less fearful. Often Muhammad wished to die, but he would again feel the call and the command of his Lord which dispelled such ideas. It was also told that he once thought of throwing himself down from the top of Mount Hira' or Mount Abu Qubays, thinking what good was this life if his greatest hope therein was to be frustrated and destroyed? Torn between these fears on one hand and despair on the other, revelation came to him after a long interval. The word of God was as clear as it was reassuring:</span> </font></font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="COLOR: red">&quot;By the forenoon<b>, </b>and by the night as it spreads its wings over the world in peace, your Lord has not forsaken you; nor is He displeased with you. Surely, the end shall be better for you than the beginning. Your Lord will soon give you of His bounty and you will be well pleased. Did He not find you an orphan and give you shelter? Did He not find you erring and guide you to the truth? Did He not find you in want and provide for you? Do not, therefore, oppress the orphan nor turn away whosoever seeks your help. And the bounty of your Lord, always proclaim.&quot;[Qur'an, 93:1-11]</span><u1:p> </u1:p></font></font></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="COLOR: red">Oh, what divine majesty, what peace of mind, what joy of heart and exaltation to the soul! Muhammad's fears dissolved and his dread was dissipated. He was overjoyed with this fresh evidence of his Lord's blessing and fell down in worship to God and praise of Him. There was no more reason to fear, as Khadijah had done, that God was displeased with him, and there was no cause for his dread. God had now taken him under His protection and removed from him every doubt and fear. Henceforth there was to be no thought of suicide but only of a life dedicated to calling men unto God and unto God alone. To the Almighty God on High shall all men bend their brows. To Him shall all that is in heaven and earth prostrate themselves. He alone is the True, and all that they worship besides him is false. To Him alone the heart should turn, on Him alone the soul should depend, and in Him alone the spirit should find its confirmation. The other realm is better for man than this realm. In the other realm, the soul becomes aware of all being as well as the unity of being; and in this unity space and time disappear and the needs and considerations of this realm are forgotten. It is in the other realm that the forenoon with its brilliant and dazzling sun, the night with its widespread darkness, the heavens and the stars, and the earth and the mountains all become one; and the spirit which enters into awareness of this unity is happy and felicitous. That is the life which is the objective of this life. And that is the truth which illuminated with its light the soul of Muhammad. When revelation subsided for a while, it was this truth which inspired him anew to solicit and think of his Lord and to call men unto Him. The calling of men unto God demands the purification of oneself, the shunning of evil, and the bearing with patience all the harm and injury with which the caller may meet<b>. </b>It demands that he illumine the path of true knowledge for the benefit of ignorant mankind, that he never rebuke the inquisitive, and that he never reject the man in need or oppress the orphan. Sufficient unto him must be the fact that God had chosen him to convey His message to mankind. Let this message then be the permanent subject of his conversation. Sufficient unto him must be the fact that God had found him an orphan and given him shelter under the protection of his grandfather, `Abd al Muttalib, and his uncle, Abu Talib. Sufficient unto him must be the fact that God had found him in want and provided for him through his trustworthiness, and had shown him His favor by granting to him Khadijah, the companion of his youth, of his solitude and retreat, of his prophetic mission, and of love and kindness. <b><u>Sufficient unto him must be the fact that God had found him erring and had guided him to the truth through His message. All this must be sufficient unto him. Let him now call to the truth and exert himself as heartily as he could. Such was the command of God to His Prophet (peace be upon him) whom He had chosen, whom He had not forsaken, and with whom He was not displeased.</u></b></span> <b><span style="COLOR: black">(Muhammad Husayn Haykal, <i>The Life of Muhammad (Allah's peace and blessing be upon him)</i>, Translated by Isma'il Razi A. al-Faruqi, <a href="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/MH_LM/from_the_beginning_of_revelation.htm"><font color="#3333ff">Source</font></a>)</span></b><u1:p> </u1:p></font></font></p>

I stood in my place transfixed. I tried to shift my eyes away from him. He was in every direction I looked at. I stopped in my place without any movement until Khadijah sent someone to look for me. He went down to Makkah and came back while I was standing in the same place. Gabriel then left, and I went back home. I found Khadijah at home, so I sat very close to her. She asked: 'Father of Al-Qasim! Where have you been? I sent someone to look for you. He went to Makkah and returned to me.' I told her of what I had seen. She replied: 'It is a propitious sign, O my husband. Pull yourself together, I swear by Allah that you are a Messenger for this nation.' Then she stood up and went to Waraqa and informed him. Waraqa said:&nbsp;'I&nbsp;swear by Allah that he has received the same <i>Namus</i>, i.e. angel that was sent to Moses. He is the Prophet (peace be upon him) of this nation. Tell him to be patient.'

The Prophet (peace be upon him) would ignore them and feel confident about himself because of the revelation that he would receive from God. However, this 'pause of revelation', known as the <i>Fatrah </i>period, which according to some scholars lasted sometime between 6 months to three years made the Prophet (peace be upon him) feel lonely and depressed.

The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not go around jumping from the mountain and surviving and failing to kill himself. No, he did not throw himself because Gabriel came and stopped him. Plus who was sending down these revelations to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) anyways? If these were the words of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) himself or if he stole them from another source then why would the Prophet (peace be upon him) purposely do such a thing to himself? This goes to show that he was not the author of the Qur'an, nor did he plagiarize it from anyone. This Quran must have been coming from a supernatural source.
