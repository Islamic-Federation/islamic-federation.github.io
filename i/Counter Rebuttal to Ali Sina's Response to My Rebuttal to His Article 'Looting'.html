<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In 1949 an International Convention was held in <!--?XML:NAMESPACE PREFIX = ST1 /--><st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Geneva</st1:place> </st1:city>and protection was granted to the victims of war. This convention prohibits violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture and taking of hostages of the defeated party. It enjoined that the wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for. Those who violate these provisions are treated as war criminals and eventually are brought to justice.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In accordance to this convention Muhammad was a war criminal. He took as hostage his prisoners of war and demanded ransom or threatened to kill them. He mutilated, tortured and murdered his prisoners of war. As a matter of fact "war" is a misnomer.</font></p>
<p><b><u><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">My Response:</font></u></b></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Islam promotes nothing but kindness to prisoners of war. Read this </font><a href="http://www.answering-christianity.com/prisoners_of_war.htm"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">article</font></a><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> for the evidence.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">The link I just posted proves from the Quran and Hadith that prisoners of war should be treated well. If there is any incident of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) which goes against the Quran, then it should be disregarded. Even Ali Sina agrees with me. He says later on in this article&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">His victims were not forewarned. Often there was no hostility between them and Muslims and they were unsuspecting and not prepared for the attack. They were raided with no prior notice and as such they were killed as unarmed civilians and not as combatants in battlefields.</font></p>
<p><b><u><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">My Response:</font></u></b></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">The only incident that I can recall unless Ali Sina refreshes my memory where Muhammad attacked his enemies by surprise were the Banu Mustaliq. However, the only reason why the Prophet attacked them first was because the Banu Mustaliq were planning to do so.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Taken from </font><a target="_blank" href="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/companion/04_abu_bakr.htm"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/companion/04_abu_bakr.htm</font></a><!--?XML:NAMESPACE PREFIX = O /--><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#ff0000" size="3">The Banu Mustaliq, a branch of Banu Khuza'a occupied the territory of Qadid on the Red Sea shore between Jeddah and Rabigh. In 527 C.E. news was brought to Madina that the Banu Mustaliq in alliance with some other tribes were gathering to make a raid on Madina. The policy of the Holy Prophet was that the Muslims should not lose the initiative in such cases, and should take such tribes by surprise. Another aspect of the policy was that action against individual tribes should be taken before they could effect an alliance.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">News reached the Prophet [pbuh] on Sha'ban 2nd. to the effect that the chief of Bani Al-Mustaliq, Al-Harith bin Dirar had mobilised his men, along with some Arabs, to attack Madinah. Buraidah bin Al-Haseeb Al-Aslami was immediately despatched to verify the reports. He had some words with Abi Dirar, who confirmed his intention of war. He later sent a reconnoiterer to explore the positions of the Muslims but he was captured and killed. The Prophet [pbuh] summoned his men and ordered them to prepare for war. Before leaving, Zaid bin Haritha was mandated to see to the affairs of Madinah and dispose them. On hearing the advent of the Muslims, the disbelievers got frightened and the Arabs going with them defected and ran away to their lives. Abu Bakr was entrusted with the banner of the Emigrants, and that of the Helpers went to Sa'd bin 'Ubada. The two armies were stationed at a well called Muraisi. Arrow shooting went on for an hour, and then the Muslims rushed and engaged with the enemy in a battle that ended in full victory for the Muslims. Some men were killed, women and children of the disbelievers taken as captives, and a lot of booty fell to the lot of the Muslims. Only one Muslim was killed by mistake by a Helper. Amongst the captives was Juwairiyah, daughter of Al-Harith, chief of the disbelievers. The Prophet [pbuh] married her and, in compensation, the Muslims had to manumit a hundred others of the enemy prisoners who embraced Islam, and were then called the Prophet's in-laws.</font> <font color="#000000"><b>[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/112,113; Ibn Hisham 2/289,290,294,295]</b></font></font></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This was also narrated by Aasim bin Amr bin Qutada and collected by Ibn Hajar Al Asqalani in Fathul Bari (496/7).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">So obviously the Prophet is not going to wait around and let them attack first. Obviously the Prophet is going to attack them by surprise. It was a military strategy. What kind of commander would let the enemy know in advance that he is going to attack them? That would only prepare them for the fight and result in heavier casualties on the other side.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b><u><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">Ali Sina:</font></u></b></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Muslims might say the </font><a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/91.htm"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Geneva Convention</font></a><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> was singed in the last century. How Muhammad can be found guilty of violating laws that did not exist at his time? The answer is that although these laws are newly written, they are based on ancient ethics. Dealing with the prisoners of war justly, has nothing to do with laws. This is a matter of conscience and fairness. Can we say Attila the Hun, Genghis Khan or even Hitler were innocent because when they were doing their massacres and atrocities, the Geneva Convention did not exist? The law is new, but the morality of that is as old as mankind.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The question that we have to ask ourselves is whether what Muhammad did was ethically right? It certainly was not. Did Muhammad like to be treated they way he treated others? Of course not! When a group of Bedouins stole some of his "stolen camels" and killed the shepherd, Muhammad found them, cut their extremities and left them in the sun to die a painful slow death. If stealing was so bad that deserved such harsh and inhumane punishment, why he would engage in that activity? Why he would raid unarmed people, kill them and loot their belongings?</font></p>
<p><b><u><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">My Response:</font></u></b></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Muslims believe in equality, which is a universal principle.&nbsp;</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">The reason why the Prophet applied such a brutal punishment to those Bedouins was because the Prophet found out that those Bedouins did the same exact thing to the shepherd.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Pagans were not as bad as Muslims. They were much more civilized and humane.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">When Nadr ibn Harith, Muhammad's own cousin who in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mecca</st1:place> </st1:city>had derided him was captured in the battle of Badr, he besought Musab, the person who was carrying him handcuffed to Muhammad to intercede for him. Musab reminded him that he had denied faith and insulted the Prophet. "Ah" said Nadr, "had the Quraish made you a prisoner, they would never have put you to death!" "Even where it so", Musab scornfully replied, "I am not as you are; <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><font color="#ff0000">Islam has rent all bonds asunder</font></b>". "<i>Idrab anqihu</i>" (strike off his neck) shouted Muhammad with blood in his eyes upon seeing Nadr and the poor man was beheaded at once. His corpse was thrown in the well along with other victims.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Another prisoner in that battle was Oqba. When he was brought for execution, he ventured to expostulate, and demand why he should be treated more vigorously than the other captives. "Because of your enmity to God and to his Prophet," replied Muhammad. <i>"And my</i> <i><span style="COLOR: black">little girl!</span></i><span style="COLOR: black">" cried Oqba, in the bitterness of his soul, "<i>who will take care of her</i>? " - "<b>Hell-fire</b>!" exclaimed the heartless conqueror; and on the instant his victim was hewn to the ground and blood gushed from his slit gullet. Then Muhammad praised his Allah "<b>I give thanks unto Allah that hath slain thee, and comforted mine eyes thereby</b>." [<i>Waqidi</i>, p108] </span></font></font></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">These are the traits of a narcissist psychopath. He could not forgive those who insulted him and had hurt his gigantic ego.&nbsp;He took immense pleasure, taking revenge of those who had humiliated him.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#ff0000" size="3">In the Battle of Badr, the Muslims captured 70 prisoners of war, of whom only 3 were put to death: Uqba ibn Abi Ma'it, An-Nadr ibn Al-Harith and Tu`aymah ibn `Udday.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">If the Prophet was a psychopath he would have ordered the execution of all the 70 prisoners. But he only ordered it for those 3.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">The Prophet did not only punish them because they insulted him. When the Prophet was in Mecca, the people insulted and abused him and when he conquered Mecca later on, he forgave them all. He had the power to kill them all but he didn't.&nbsp; The reason for Nadr ibn Al Harith and Oqba is the same reason for the order of the killing of Kab bin Ashraf. Their insults and public dismay of the Prophet made people rise up and fight against the Prophet. So their words caused a lot of damage.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><b><u><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">Ali Sina:</font></u></b></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The reason the non-Muslims lost was because they were inhibited by their humanness and unwilling to use brutal force against the Muslims to subdue them. They believed in freedom of belief and "multiculturalism". They had no clue how evil and demonic Islam is and because of this underestimation they lost. This is the very weakness of the non-Muslims today. If Muslims are not stopped with anything it takes, they will win and the non-Muslims will be slaughtered with the same brutality that Nadr and Oqba, or the more recent victims of Islam such as Daniel Pearls and Margaret Hasan&nbsp; were slaughtered.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">It is foolish to believe you can overcome evil will kindness. It is foolish to believe that the followers of a ruthless man such as Muhammad will deal with you justly when they come to power. This mistake was committed by many Iranians who stayed in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Iran</st1:place> </st1:country-region>after the Islamic revolution because they thought they have done nothing wrong to fear. They paid this error of judgment with their lives. Evil must be crushed with force. How much force?... As much as it takes! There is no price high enough to preserve our freedom and our lives. Kindness must be shown to those who denounce evil. But those who support it must be dealt with our wrath. </font></font></span></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">For the sake of argument, let us say that people in those days were savages. At least this is the lie that Muslims want us to believe. Is this a good excuse for Muhammad to raid, rape, loot, and massacre people with savagery? Did Muhammad come to guide people to the right path or was he a victim of the bad traditions of his people? Didn't he call the pagans ignorant? If so, why did he follow their ways? The man who taught his followers with how many stones they should wipe their rears after the call of nature did not know looting and stealing is evil and he should not set that kind of examples. Are we supposed to believe that he was a prophet?&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Muslims have very circular reasoning. They claim that Muhammad came to guide the ignorant people to the right path. But when we point out the evils committed by this man, they say he was a man of his time and did what others were doing. We are not talking about the way he dressed. This is raiding, raping, looting and killing innocent people we are talking about?</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Raping? Where did Ali Sina show evidence of rape? Where did he show evidence of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) doing anything wrong at all to innocent people?</font></p>
<p><b><u><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">Ali Sina:</font></u></b></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Let us not words deceive us. The "right path" for Muslims has totally a different meaning. This term for them means following the mandates of Muhammad and acting like him. It is not the same right path and right deeds most of us are familiar with. In fact most Islamic "right paths" are very demonic - like killing the unbelievers and looting their properties. In Islam this is the right path because Muhammad did it and asked his followers to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Although the claim that pagans were worse than Muslims is a lie, it still does not justify Muhammad's crimes. This man claimed to be the prophet of God, "<font color="#008000"><b>the best example to follow</b></font>", an "<b><font color="#008000">honorable person</font></b>" and "<font color="#008000"><b>the best of creation</b></font>". In a Hadith Qudsi he makes his Allah say to him: <b><font color="#008000">"Were it not for you, I would not have created the universe." </font></b>Imagine the level of insanity! How could such a person with such outlandish claims act like the worst criminal? If anyone else does what Muhammad did, wouldn't you say that this person is a criminal? Then why a messenger of God, the person who thinks the universe is created for him, should act like a criminal?&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">I will not comment on what is written in green. That hadith is supposedly from a Hadith Qudsi. I do not know the reliability of the Hadith. But I doubt that it is true because it is known that the first thing that Allah created was the pen and not Muhammad's soul. Anyways that is irrelevant.

<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">When it says that the war booty is for Allah and his Messenger, it simply means that it is for the cause of Islam. It does not mean that Allah is going to consume the war booty.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><b><u><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">My Response:</font></u></b></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">The Jews of Khaybar were responsible for the uprising of armies against the Muslims in the Battle of the Trench (or ditch). They would go to Makkah and encourage them to wage war against the Muslims. Theses Jews would hide in their fortresses in Khaybar. So obviously they needed to be dealt with. So Muhammad invaded Khaybar. If the Prophet was able to individually punish these people he would have. But they would lock them selves up&nbsp; so the Prophet had no choice. He even tried burning down their trees to scare them so that he would not resort to going inside the fortress to get them. But they left him no choice. Yes, the Prophet Muhammad was a man of mercy, but he was also a man of justice. Does Ali Sina expect Muhammad to forgive all those who fight him? If he did that, then everyone would try attacking Muhammad and would not worry about getting punished if they lost. So Muhammad needed to make an example out of anyone who dared to fight or harm him. This is self defense. This is a universal principle.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Again, as I previously said. Muslims did not intentionally start wars to loot or gain booty of war or whatever. They never attacked anyone who did no harm to them. In my previous article I showed that the Muslims used the booty of war that they acquired for the benefits of the society and to help the poor and helpless. Ali Sina did not respond back to that. Because that shows that the Muslims did not start wars to get war booty out of greed and keep it for themselves to be rich.&nbsp;</font></p>

Jizya is extortion fee. Non-Muslims must work and maintain the Muslims or face death. See this hadith:</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">According to the saying of the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him): Allah has placed truth upon Umar's tongue and heart.

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: purple">The sixth case is that of borrowing a substantial sum of money from a Muslim individual for financing a major battle. "Isma'il son of Ibrahim son of Abdullah, son of Abu Rabi'ah al-Makhzumi has reported to us from his father who reported about his grandfather that when the Prophet (peace be upon him) was to attack Hunayn he borrowed thirty or forty thousand from him. He repaid it when he came back. Then the Prophet (peace be upon him) told him: 'May Allah bless you with prosperity in your family and your property. The proper recompense for lending is repayment and gratitude'. In another version of this tradition recorded by Nasa'i, the amount of the loan is a definite forty thousand. The same is true of Ahmad ibn Hanbal in his Musnad. As regards the source of payment, both versions mention money that accrued to the Prophet (peace be upon him) subsequently. The battle of Hunayn took place in the eighth year after hijrah immediately after the conquest of Mekkah. These were comparatively better days for state finances. <b>The accrual of money referred to in the tradition could have been from the spoils of war consequent to the victory at Hunayn</b>. The above is clear case of borrowing for defense purposes. It is also evident that the sum paid back equaled the sum borrowed and no extra payment were involved.</span>&nbsp;</font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">This kind of absurdity blows the mind of any rational person. But it does not blow mine. I know how the Muslim mind works. Muslims genuinely cannot see that their thinking is demonic. For years I heard these very absurdities and never once I thought they are evil. My conscience was numbed. Muslims' conscience is numbed. They are genuinely incapable of rational thought or human feelings. They have lost their humanity. There is nothing we can say that can bring them to their senses. Nothing can make them reason. It happened to me and it has happened to many others but it is extremely hard. Muslims are possessed as if by a demonic spirit which which has paralyzed their brains. You know what they will write after reading this? "My faith in Islam increased". This is how brainless these wretched souls have become. </font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Mr. Zawadi says:<b><span style="COLOR: red"> "They did not invade people intentionally to pillage their towns and villages and to take the booty. It was only during time of war." &nbsp; </span></b></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">No of course it was not intentional. The Muslims were blown to the towns of their victims by wind and accidentally their swords killed their men. Therefore the innocent Muslims had no choice but to clean the town and bring the wives and children of their victims as slaves. It was after all the "Bounties of Allah". How could they reject it?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="5">&nbsp;<b><u>My Response:</u></b></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Ali Sina is trying to be sarcastic. As I kept explaining, the Muslims never invaded anyone who did nothing wrong to them. Muslims either invaded those who were planning to attack them, attacked them already and associated and supported in any way possible those who attacked them.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">Ali Sina:</font></u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"<font color="#ff0000">It was during the time of war</font>". This is just the typical logical fallacy that Muslims love to engage in. Who started those wars?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>First of all they weren't wars but <b>raids</b>. Muhammad raided caravans, villages and towns with no warning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He ambushed them. Of course you can only loot when you attack and kill people. How else one can loot? Would people give you their money, if you don't raid them, and don't "cast terror into their hearts", as he bragged often? This means that by virtue of the fact that Muhammad raided people and killed unarmed civilians, he was entitled to rape their wives and daughters and steal their property. This logic escapes human rationality. But Muslims' brain does not work in quite the same way. They are followers of Satan. Woe to you if you don't take my warnings seriously. Woe to your children if you do not stop Muslims in their track in time. Every argument and counter argument that these Satan worshippers present depict the depravity of their mind and lays bare their demonic souls. &nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Mr. Zawadi ends his argument: "<b><span style="COLOR: red">They are not just going to leave it lying around. It is completely justifiable what they did." &nbsp; </span></b></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Of course! Once you raided innocent people and kill them, why let their property go to waist? It is yours, take it. It is all "Bounties from Allah" in gratitude for being a good servant. Their wives and children?... They too are your slaves and sex slaves. They are all yours.</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> &nbsp;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">What we learned from this debate? We learned that Islam, far from being a religion is a gangster organization that sustains itself by looting. Muslims are incapable of producing anything. They must loot to survive. Muhammad built his empire by looting and by casting terror. Muslims did the same throughout the history. You are a fool if you think they have changed or they will change. As long as they call themselves Muslims and follow Muhammad they will do what he did. They are gangsters, they are looters, and they are terrorists. Don't believe me? Just listen to what they say. &nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">And don't think just because Muslims don't engage in these activities now they will not do it once they come to power. If they don't do it now it's because they fear the bigger powers. Once that fear is no more there, they revert to their original barbarity and follow the Quran and the sunna to the letter.</font></p>

<p><b><u><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">My Response:</font></u></b></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">I urge that everyone reads this debate again and slowly and please point out to me where Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) harmed innocent people or did anything wrong. If you disagree with the fact that Muhammad had wars, then remember why he started those wars (self defense). But if you are totally against war, then you are a pacifist and that is your own subjective opinion. I urge all to be objective and really show me what Muhammad has done wrong in order to deserve condemnation.</font></p>
