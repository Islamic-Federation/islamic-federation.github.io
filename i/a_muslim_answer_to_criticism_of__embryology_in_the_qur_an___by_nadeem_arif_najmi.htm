Bookmark not defined.</b> by Dr.Lactantius. For reasons of intellectual integrity, the text of the original article has been included, with responses following it, section by section. The main aim of the article by Dr.Lactantius was to prove that the Quran contains scientific errors when it refers to embryological development, and furthermore that it copies the incorrect theories of ancient thinkers like Galen and Aristotle. As we shall soon see, the critic has been unable to prove anything of the sort, and has ended up without any objective evidence for his arguments whatsoever.</font></p>

One would expect the Qur'an to be unambiguous about such an elementary matter, but the verses listed show just how much uncertainty there appears to be in our origins.

The correct explanation is referred to by the critic himself, and is without doubt the only sensible and objective interpretation of the verses. The Quran is very clear that we were created out of the earth-<i>dust</i>, and <i>water</i>-which together forms <i>mud, mire, loam</i> or <i>wet earth</i>. The mud <i>became clay when it was dried</i>. God created mankind out of nothing-that does not mean that 'nothing' was used to create people, rather it means that at one stage humans were 'nothing' i.e. did not exist, until God decided to create them. Verse 30:19 refers to resurrection of the dead in the afterlife and not to the creation of human beings, and verse 39:6 refers to the fact that all mankind is descended from Adam i.e. all of humanity has been created from the creation of a single person-Adam. Therefore it should be clearly obvious that there is absolutely no ambiguity, no confusion and no contradiction whatsoever in the Quranic description of the origin of human life.</font></p>

As usual the missionaries have dragged in an utterly irrelevant point in order to escape the fact that their main argument (that the Quran has contradicted itself in these verses) has already been made redundant by the Muslim explanation of it. Modern science has not been able to disprove the Quranic statements that indicate that life originated from both aquatic and earthly origins, the musings of the evolutionists are yet to be accepted as scientific fact and as such the Quran can only be said to have contradicted one scientific theory and not science itself. Thus, it should be very clear to the objective reader that the Quran has not contradicted itself in the referred verses nor do they contain any scientific errors.</font></p>

However, Prof. Moore is keen to translate <i>nutfah </i>in sura 76:2 as &quot;mingled fluid&quot; [3] and explains that this Arabic term refers to the male and female fluids which contain the gametes (male sperm and female egg). While it is true that the ancient Greeks would not have been able to see individual sperm or eggs, these only being visible through the microscope, the Qur'an emphatically does <i>not</i> mention sperm or eggs; it simply says <i>nutfah.</i> This can reasonably be translated semen, or at a push, germinal fluid - which was a term used as early as Hippocrates [4] who spoke of male and female reproductive fluids (but obviously could not have been aware of the cells contained in the fluids). If <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moore</st1:place></st1:city> wishes to translate <i>nutfah</i> as germinal fluid, he inadvertently reinforces that the Qur'an is borrowing this term from the Greeks.</font></font></span></p>

Semen is apparently coming out of the area around the kidneys and back, which is a real problem for we know that the testicles are the sites of sperm production (although the ancient Greeks were not so convinced. Aristotle for example amusingly believed that they functioned as weights to keep the seminal passages open during sexual intercourse [5]). </font></font></span></p>

In other words, in a very convoluted fashion the sperm originates from the area between the loins and ribs because that is where the testicles which are producing the sperm originally form.</font></font></span></p>

The Greek physician Hippocrates and his followers taught in the fifth century BC that semen comes from all the fluid in the body, diffusing from the brain into the spinal marrow, before passing through the kidneys and via the testicles into the penis [7]. Clearly according to this view sperm originates from the region of the kidneys, and although there is obviously no substance to this teaching today, it was well-known in Muhammed's day, and shows how the Qur'an could contain such an erroneous statement. </font></font></span></p>

We can find examples of this in sura 7:172 &quot;when thy Lord drew forth from the Children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants&quot; or 4:23 &quot;prohibited to you (for marriage) are ... wives of your sons proceeding from your loins&quot;. But if so then it has to be accepted that this is a common usage for Middle Eastern cultures [8]; in the Torah God promises Jacob that &quot;kings shall come out of your loins (<i>chalatzecha</i>)&quot; (Gen 35:11). Later in the Bible a promise is made to David's &quot;son that shall come forth out of your loins&quot; (I Kings 8:19) and in the New Testament Peter refers to the same person as &quot;one from the fruit of his loins&quot; (Greek <i>osphus</i>). However, these are examples of a metaphorical use of the word &quot;loins&quot; (Arabic <i>sulb</i>). Sura 86:6 is clearly talking about the physical act of intercourse; gushing fluid and ribs (<i>tar a'ib</i>) are both very physical and in the context of this verse they clearly refer to the site of semen production as wrongly taught by Hippocrates. So we have found the first example of an incorrect ancient Greek idea re-emerging in the Qur'an. </font></span></p>

However that does not mean to say, that the Quran has not provided <i>any</i> new information on embryology or referred to <i>any</i> facts that would have been beyond human observation. As for the meaning of the word 'nutfah', the word simply means 'drop' or 'small dribbling quantity of liquid'. In verses where ejaculation is clearly referred to i.e. 'nutfah gushing forth' it clearly does refer to sperm. However that does not exclude the possibility that it might have another meaning in verses where ejaculation is not discussed. In 76:2 the creation of man from a 'mixed drop' is referred to. This allows Muslims to interpret the word as 'zygote' in those other verses, since that would fit the description of a 'mixed drop' forming as it does, from the mixing of the male and female gamates. Nutfah does not have one meaning in the Quran; the correct meaning can only be reached after studying the other characteristics of any particular verse. 'Germinal fluid' is not the correct translation, nor the one proposed by Dr Moore, he states:</font></p>

That is to say, that the author of the Quran demonstrates knowledge that only a part of sperm (a <i>lowly fluid</i> due to it's area of origin) is required for the creation of the human being. Also the word 'nutfah' itself indicates a very small quantity of liquid. This is not at all something that is observable to humans, nor is it mentioned in any ancient source (including Greek!) other than the Quran. Yet modern science has informed us that only one of the spermatozoa from the millions present in the 'drop' is required for fertilisation. I.e. only the 'sulala' of the sperm-drop is required for the creation of man, exactly as the Quran had stated over a fourteen centuries ago. This is one, among the many logically irrefutable facts of science in the Quran.</font></p>

Yet, the Quran is a book of divine revelation and deserves more than just 'casual' perusal and analysis. The Quran describes the creation of man from a 'drop emitted' i.e. sperm and describes this as 'proceeding <i>min baini</i> the <i>sulb</i> and the <i>ta'raib</i>'. The common translation of the words 'min baini' is 'from between' (although it can mean 'coming from the conjunction of' two elements), of 'sulb' is 'backbone' and ta'raib is 'ribs'. If we accept this translation then there might be several explanations. The first has already been discussed by the critic i.e. the testicles originally form in this area, and in this sense the sperm does originally emanate or proceed from between the back and ribs. </font></p>

He states that this verse, replies to the claims of the unbelievers at the time of revelation that denied the reality of resurrection. In this context the Quran has euphemistically referred to the male genital area as 'between the backbone and the ribs' since it does not want to refer to the organ by name for reasons of purity and also because it was effectively saying 'you are denying God's message when you are just a lowly mortal created from a place not even worth mentioning'. He has shown in his article how a straight external line from the backbone and ribs <i>does </i>cover the male sexual area including the testicles. So, the Quran has not made any scientific error but referred euphemistically to the male genital area, from which sperm is poured out. Please read his full article for clarification of any doubts about the use of euphemisms like this in the Quran.</font></p>

My mother and I went through three different tafseers of this verse.&nbsp; (See above for references).&nbsp; Verdict: Bucaille appears to be right, and most translations are misleading at best.&nbsp; It really requires a good understanding of Arabic to understand this verse.&nbsp; <b>Note that 'sulb' is *singular*.&nbsp; In the dictionary by Wehr you cite below, you will see that its meaning of backbone is *only* when we take the *plural* word of sulb (aslaab</b>).&nbsp; <b>In its singular form, it means hardening</b>.

As for the claim that the Quran copied Greek thinkers, well it rests on the favourite (and unproved!) assumption of missionaries that similarity implies borrowing. If we apply this yardstick to the Bible, we will have to admit it has 'borrowed' from other sources since it's description of the flood of Noah is 'similar' to the Gilgamesh epic and flood epics from around the world that predate the Christian scripture. It's seems too many Christians have forgotten what Jesus (pbuh) said about wood beams and splinters.</font></p>

In comparison with the meaning of <i>nutfah, </i>it is rather more difficult to understand what <i>alaqa</i> means. Many different suggestions have been made: clot (Pickthall, Maulana Muhammed Ali, Muhammed Zafrulla Khan, Hamidullah), small lump of blood (Kasimirski), leech-like clot (Yusuf Ali), and &quot;leech, suspended thing or blood clot&quot; (<st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moore</st1:place></st1:city>, <i>op. cit.</i>). <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moore</st1:place></st1:city> suggests that the appearance of an embryo of 24 days' gestation resembles a leech, though this is rather debatable. In side view the developing umbilicus (genetically part of the embryo) is almost as big as the &quot;leech-shaped&quot; part into which a human is formed and the developing placenta (which also consists of tissue that is genetically from the embryo) is much larger than the embryo. It is claimed that the ancient sages would not have been able to see an embryo about 3mm long and describe it as leech-like, but Aristotle correctly described the function of the umbilical cord, by which the embryo &quot;clings&quot; to the uterus wall in the fourth century B.C. [10]. It is impossible to believe the suggestion of Bachir Torki [11] that <i>alaq</i> in 96:2 means links, referring to the gene code of DNA, as this makes a nonsense out of other verses where the word is used, such as 22:5 (&quot;we made you from a drop of sperm, then from that a gene code, then from that a little lump of flesh....&quot;). </font></font></span></p>

He says that <i>alaqa</i> has the same meaning as a clot of blood. In 96:2 the word <i>alaq</i> is used, which is both a collective plural and a verbal noun. The latter form conveys the sense of man being created from clinging material or possibly clay, which is consistent with the creation of Adam in the Bible from the dust of the ground (Genesis 2:7) and some of the other Qur'anic verses listed above. However, the translators of the Qur'an have all translated <i>alaq</i> as &quot;clot&quot; as opposed to &quot;clinging&quot; in 96:2 because the use of the singular <i>alaqa</i> elsewhere forces them to use &quot;clot&quot; here too, despite the attraction for the meaning &quot;clinging&quot; or leech-like which is perhaps more scientifically accurate. </font></font></span></p>

Ibn Kathir wrote that when the drop of water (<i>nutfah</i>) settled in the womb it stayed there for forty days and then became a red clot (<i>alaqa</i>), staying there for another forty days before turning to <i>mugdah</i>, a piece of flesh without shape or form. Finally it began to take on a shape and form. Both ar-Razi and as-Suyuti [13] claimed that the dust referred both to Adam's creation and to the man's discharge; <i>nutfah</i> referred to the water from the male and <i>alaqa</i> was a solidified piece of blood clot. Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya (died about AD 1350) wrote that &quot;the foetus is a living or dead babe animal which is sometimes found in the womb of a slaughtered animal, and its blood is congested&quot; [14]. Another great physician, Ibn al-Quff wrote some 13 out of 60 chapters from &quot;On Health Preservation&quot; about embryology and pregnancy. He included a further stage of development one week after conception, the foam stage or <i>raghwah</i>. Up to 16 days the embryo was <i>alaqa</i> (clot) and after 27 to 30 days the clot turns into a lump of meat, <i>mugdah</i> [15]. These dates must be regarded as very approximate but are nevertheless a major improvement on what one of the most reliable Hadiths says about foetal development, as we shall see later. </font></font></span></p>

The idea that <i>mugdah</i> means chewed flesh is a later, and less accurate translation of the word, but the idea has persisted because it is claimed that the somites from which the backbone and other trunk structures develop bear a passing resemblance to teeth marks implanted in plastercine. It must be said that not only is this an imaginative interpretation however, but besides, Moore cannot claim that the <i>mugdah</i> should occur at 26-27 days since at that point the embryo is a mere 4mm long. One would have to wait around 8 weeks before the embryo was the size of chewed flesh (if a mouthful is defined as being 20-30mm wide), which is what <i>mugdah</i> really means. And in the following Hadith, transmitted by Bukhari and Muslim, Muhammed claims that the <i>mugdah</i> stage occurs between days 80 and 120. Yet by this time the foetus is considerably larger than a lump of flesh the size of which a man can chew, and looks very human-like and totally unlike meat. </font></font></span></p>

However, according to modern embryologists including Prof. Moore, the tissue from which bone originates, known as mesoderm, is the same tissue as that from which muscle (&quot;flesh&quot;) develops [17]. Thus bone and muscles begin to develop simultaneously, rather than sequentially. Whereas however most of the muscle tissue that we have is laid down before birth, bones continue to develop and calcify (strengthen with calcium) right into one's teenage years. So far from bones being clothed with flesh, it would be more accurate if the Qur'an had said that muscles started to develop at the same time as bones, but completed their development earlier. The idea that bones are clothed with flesh is not only scientifically completely false, but is directly copied from the ancient Greek doctor Galen, as we shall see shortly.</span></font></font></p>

Muslims were presented with a book from God which told them that &quot;He (God) created humanity from an Alaq.&quot; Those who read this verse &quot;interpreted&quot; it based upon the meaning they felt most appropriate. Humans have blood in them so the verse must mean &quot;blood clot.&quot; How could a person be created from worms, they reasoned? However, the verse remained in Arabic and the text retained its dual meaning despite how humanity had tried to understand the meaning. When some people chose to translate the meanings of the Qur'an into English they were faced with a situation where they had to chose one or the other. Unlike the original Arabic, the English language would not allow for a dual meaning. Thus, the translators looked at both meanings, &quot;clump of blood,&quot; and &quot;leech&quot; and tried to reason, &quot;Which one appears to my intellect to be the intended meaning, for humans to have been created from a blood clot or for them to have been created from leeches?&quot; Obviously, just as humans would have a hard time imagining &quot;bugs&quot; flying around in their software, so too did they have a hard time imagining &quot;leeches&quot; transmuting into humans, so the verse was translated as &quot;blood clot.&quot;</font></i></p>

However, the translators of the Qur'an have all translated alaq as &quot;clot&quot; as opposed to &quot;clinging&quot; in 96:2 because the use of the singular alaqa elsewhere forces them to use &quot;clot&quot; here too, despite the attraction for the meaning &quot;clinging&quot; or leech-like which is perhaps more scientifically accurate. </font></span></i></p>

However these arguments are in themselves laughable and absurd. The Quran uses the word Alaq/Alaqah in a specific physical context i.e. the creation of the human being. Therefore of the hundreds of translations of the word only those should be used that apply to a physical entity-'love' and 'devotion' and 'dowry' etc cannot be the true meaning. Leech, clinging object, blood clot and clay are the only meanings that can be derived from the Quran. Meanings like 'links' etc are fanciful interpretations on the part of some Muslims. The meaning cannot be 'clay' since there is no logical reason why the word for clay would have not been used in these verses, when in countless verses the creation of man from clay has already been described! This leaves three meanings:</font></p>

Just as the leech derives blood from the host, the human embryo derives blood from the decidua or pregnant endometrium. It is remarkable how much the embryo of 23-24 days resembles a leech (Fig. 2). As there were no microscopes or lenses available in the 7th century, doctors would not have known that the human embryo had this leech-like appearance. In the early part of the fourth week, the embryo is just visible to the unaided eye because it is smaller than a kernel of wheat. </font></i></p>

In side view the developing umbilicus (genetically part of the embryo) is almost as big as the &quot;leech-shaped&quot; part into which a human is formed and the developing placenta (which also consists of tissue that is genetically from the embryo) is much larger than the embryo. It is claimed that the ancient sages would not have been able to see an embryo about 3mm long and describe it as leech-like, but Aristotle correctly described the function of the umbilical cord, by which the embryo &quot;clings&quot; to the uterus wall in the fourth century B.C.</span></i></font></font></p>

The implication of his criticism is that if an embryo does not look like a leech from all angles, and the leech-like part is not the largest part of the embryo than the description 'leech-like' is incorrect. This is a view I simply do not share. For an embryo to be leech-like it can resemble a leech from any angle, and the leech-shaped part need not be the biggest part. As for being able to see the embryo's leech-like shape, he has quoted Aristotle describing the embryo 'clinging' but has not found any evidence to suggest that any source other the Quran has referred to the embryo as leech-like! As such Dr.Moore's contention that human beings could not have observed the leech-like shape of the embryo will stand until such time that the missionaries can prove that any pre-modern source other than the Quran has referred to this fact.</font></p>

I am sure the reader will appreciate now that alaqah does have two precise scientific meanings neither of which is subject to any scientific or linguistic criticism whatsoever!</font></p>

While Muslims gave the utmost respect for those individuals, we do not consider them to be free from error. They were human beings and did not have the scientific knowledge to understand the Quran correctly and so used whatever theories were around at that time to interpret the Quran. Now that we know they were wrong, we can safely reject their interpretations and use the scientific knowledge at our disposal to interpret the Quran.

In my opinion any hadith even if is classified as 'Sahih' by scholars should be rejected as false if it contradicts the Quran or the established knowledge of mankind. This is the case, because the Hadith were compiled over two centuries after the Prophet (pbuh) had passed away and no-one can guarantee that mistakes were not made in transmission over the immense amount of time between the Prophet (pbuh) saying something, and it being written down by the collectors of Hadith. I would request the critic to stick to the issue i.e. the Quran and embryology and not confuse matters by referring to the Hadith. The Quran is free of errors and the Hadith is not, this is something that many Muslims acknowledge and as such criticism of the Hadith do not prove anything about the Quran and embryology.</font></p>

It must be said that not only is this an imaginative interpretation however, but besides, Moore cannot claim that the mugdah should occur at 26-27 days since at that point the embryo is a mere 4mm long. One would have to wait around 8 weeks before the embryo was the size of chewed flesh (if a mouthful is defined as being 20-30mm wide), which is what mugdah really means</font></span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">So what does 'mugdah' really mean-chewed lump or a chewable-size lump? I consulted the translations of the Quran by Shakir, Yusuf Ali, Marmaduke Pickthall, Muhsin/Hillali and Sher Ali. All of them described the word as 'lump of flesh', 'little lump of flesh' or 'shapeless flesh'. <u>Indeed the critic himself has made references to the translation of the word as 'flesh without shape or form' by Ibn Kathir and 'lump of meat' by Ibn al-Quff </u>It would appear therefore that the translation of the word as 'chewed lump' by some Muslims is not accurate, but the translation suggested by the critic and attributed (with questionable accuracy) to the commentator Razi is not a translation but one man's interpretation. Razi was wondering how small or large the 'lump' was and suggested it was large enough to chew. The word itself does not mean 'chew-sized lump' but simply 'small lump'. After the alaqah stage, the embryo does indeed become a 'small lump of flesh' without any distinctive human features or form, until the bones and muscles begin to develop. Below is a picture of the embryo at this stage:</font></p>

However, according to modern embryologists including Prof. Moore, the tissue from which bone originates, known as mesoderm, is the same tissue as that from which muscle (&quot;flesh&quot;) develops [17]. Thus bone and muscles begin to develop simultaneously, rather than sequentially. Whereas however most of the muscle tissue that we have is laid down before birth, bones continue to develop and calcify (strengthen with calcium) right into one's teenage years. So far from bones being clothed with flesh, it would be more accurate if the Qur'an had said that muscles started to develop at the same time as bones, but completed their development earlier. The idea that bones are clothed with flesh is not only scientifically completely false, but is directly copied from the ancient Greek doctor Galen, as we shall see shortly.</font></span></i></p>

Interestingly, the critic has decided not to quote directly from 'modern embryologists including Prof. Moore' but rather referred to the book knowing most of his readers won't have the time to check whether Dr Moore has really said what he is telling us he said, and whether it means what he would like it to mean!

If we translate <i>alaqa</i> as &quot;clot&quot; it means that the Qur'an is completely wrong about human development, since there is absolutely no stage during which the embryo consists of a clot. The only situation in which an embryo might appear like a clot is during a miscarriage, in which case the clotted blood which is seen to emerge (much of which comes from the mother incidentally) is solidified and by definition no longer alive. So if ever an embryo appeared to look like a clot it would never develop any further into a human; it would be a dead mass of bloody miscarrying flesh. Since Muhammed had several wives it is entirely likely that he would be very familiar with miscarriages. Alternatively it could be hinting at Aristotle's incorrect belief that the embryo originated from the combination of male sperm and female menstrual blood. </font></font></span></p>

A further problem with this view is that if the <i>alaqa</i> is translated &quot;leech&quot; because it appears to be clinging to the uterus wall, does this mean that the foetus only clings to the uterus wall for a few days?

It also begs the question as to why, if the Qur'an really is giving us a highly precise scientific account of human development, it only mentions four stages, <i>nutfah, alaqa</i>, <i>mugdah</i>, plus the clothing of bones with flesh.

The first is that in which. as is seen both in abortions and in dissection, the form of the semen prevails (Arabic nutfah). At this time, Hippocrates too, the all-marvelous, does not yet call the conformation of the animal a foetus; as we heard just now in the case of semen voided in the sixth day, he still calls it semen. But when it has been filled with blood (Arabic alaqa), and heart, brain and liver are still unarticulated and unshaped yet have by now a certain solidarity and considerable size, this is the second period; the substance of the foetus has the form of flesh and no longer the form of semen. Accordingly you would find that Hippocrates too no longer calls such a form semen but, as was said, foetus. The third period follows on this, when, as was said, it is possible to see the three ruling parts clearly and a kind of outline, a silhouette, as it were, of all the other parts (Arabic mugdah). You will see the conformation of the three ruling parts more clearly, that of the parts of the stomach more dimly, and much more still, that of the limbs. Later on they form &quot;twigs&quot;, as Hippocrates expressed it, indicating by the term their similarity to branches. The fourth and final period is at the stage when all the parts in the limbs have been differentiated; and at this part Hippocrates the marvelous no longer calls the foetus an embryo only, but already a child, too when he says that it jerks and moves as an animal now fully formed (Arabic `a new creation')....</font></font></span></i></p>

Simply because the Quran describes the first stage as 'the clinging stage' does not mean that it stops clinging after that, but since the embryo continues to change, these changes are described as the next stages of development. I.e. the <i>alaqa</i> stage is the not the only one where the embryo clings to the uterus wall, but is the first one and is described as the 'clinging stage' for this reason. The critic makes the <i>basic assumption</i> that because the Quran says the embryo is a clinging thing and then becomes a small lump of flesh, that it is implying that it ceases to cling when it becomes a lump of flesh. I do not agree with his assumption. Furthermore, even if we accept this argument it can only apply to the translation of the alaqa as 'clinging thing' and not 'leech-like', since it is possible to argue that the embryo is no longer 'leech-like' after days 23/24 of gestation because it no longer resembles a leech even if some of its behaviours (i.e. clinging, extracting blood) are still similar to that of a leech i.e. the description 'leech-like' might refer only to the physical appearance of the embryo, which does indeed disappear after the alaqa stage and not to it's behaviour. As for the alleged words of the Prophet (pbuh), I have already responded to that point.</font></p>

The Quran has only referred to the development of the child in the womb to remind people that he has created them and will resurrect them. In order to remind them of their creation the major changes that occur up until the embryo becomes fully human-like (in the eighth week) are described. As long as the Quran has described these changes accurately, there is no point questioning why other changes are not described. The purpose of the Quran is to describe the creation of the human in the womb, and if it does this accurately (and I believe that it does) then it cannot be subject to criticism, even if it does not mention everything that occurs at every stage in the womb-since the purpose of the Quran is not to give a textbook account of all development during pregnancy but remind people of who created them and how he did this. The other details are excluded because they are not relevant to the message of the Quran. I would have thought that this would have been commonsense, but obviously the missionaries see things differently! I have responded earlier to his ramblings about the 'ambiguity' of Arabic words and their 'imprecise meanings' I will not repeat myself again. Nutfah, alaqa, mugdah and lahm all have very clear and precise meanings in Arabic, and none of them contradict what has been established by science!</font></p>

The fourth and final stage, puer, was when all the organs were well formed, joints were freely moveable, and the foetus began to move [20].

Alaqa does not mean 'clot' but 'leech-like' as we have already seen and so does not correspond with Galen's account of the 'blood filled foetus'. Wait a minute! The critic himself is describing mugdah as 'the morsel of chewed flesh' when just a moment ago he was saying that this was inaccurate translation of the word. Knives are long, and memories short! Back to the point 'having the form of flesh' as described by Galen is totally distinct from 'chewed flesh', 'chewable flesh' or 'small lump of flesh'-whatever translation one uses to describe mugdah-one wonders where 'Muhammed' decided to add the size and precise details to Galen's account of the flesh?!. The fourth stage is similar only in describing the flesh covering the bones, but having one stage the same as the Quran simply does not prove what the critic is trying so very hard to prove. The Quran describes the creation of man from a drop of sperm (nutfah), then a zygote (nutfah amshajjin), then as a leech-like thing (alaq), then as small lump of partly formed flesh (mugdah), then the formations of bones and muscles covering them. The Quran's account is totally different from that of Galen! The critic's entire argument collapses unless we accept that alaq means 'blood clot', nutfah means 'semen' and mugdah means 'flesh-like'. It is only if we accept these translations that any link can possibly be made between Galen's non-scientific account and the one found in the Quran. Since we have already demonstrated how each of these terms has other more appropriate meanings, I think that flaws of his arguments are obvious for all to see. The Quran does not copy Galen at all-the critic has failed miserably in trying to prove otherwise. As for the statement by a Muslim, all I can say is that he is badly mistaken-just like some Christians who deny that the Bible is wholly the word of God but still call themselves Christian!</font></p>

For example there is a Hadith in which Muhammed is questioned about why a group of red camels have a grey camel among them, and it is due to a hidden trait. But Aristotle noticed that babies who were born that looked unlike either of their parents would often take on the appearance of their grandparents [23], so that the characteristic skipped a generation, being what we now know as recessive. He also tells us of a woman from <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Elis</st1:place></st1:city> who took a black husband and although their daughter was not black, their daughter's daughter was black, demonstrating a gene which skipped a generation in exactly the same way as Muhammed described [24]. </font></font></span></p>

Surely this is not referring to dominant and recessive genes at all, as certain Muslims have claimed [26], but is simply repeating the incorrect belief of Hippocrates that both men and women produce both male and female sperm. The sex of the resulting child is determined by which sperm overwhelms the other in strength or quantity: </font></font></span></p>

Here is a further point: if (a) both partners produce a stronger sperm then a male is the result, whereas if (b) they produce a weak form, then a female is the result. But if (c) one partner produces one kind of sperm, and the other another then the resultant sex is determined by whichever sperm prevails in quantity. For suppose that the weak sperm is much greater in quantity than the stronger sperm: then the stronger sperm is overwhelmed and, being mixed with weak, results in a female. If on the contrary the strong sperm is greater in quantity than the weak, and the weak is overwhelmed, it results in a male&quot; [27]. </font></font></span></p>

Usaid reported that Muhammed said 40 or perhaps 50 days, not 42, and Abu Tufail maintains that Muhammed said to Hudhaifa b. Usaid that sperm resided in the womb for 40 days), Hippocrates taught that it took 30 days for the male genitals to form and 42 for the female embryo [29].

Elsewhere it has been suggested that they are the abdominal wall, the uterine wall and the amniotic sac in which the foetus sits. This is entirely observable to the naked eye, as Hippocrates described dissecting pregnant dogs to find puppies sitting in the amniotic sac inside the uterus [30]. A rather macabre practice of Queen Cleopatra was to rip open the wombs of her pregnant slave-girls in order to see their foetuses, according both to Rabbinic traditions and Plinius [31]. Furthermore, the Romans introduced the custom of opening the womb of a pregnant woman if she died before she had delivered her baby; the woman and her baby would be buried side-by-side, thus giving rise to the term &quot;Caesarean section&quot;.</font></font></span></p>

In fact 80:19 is talking about man's origins from a drop of sperm, and 80:21 about his death and burial, so it is entirely logical that 80:20 refers not to the process of parturition (giving birth) but to the whole of man's life being made easy for him by God. In the context this makes a lot more sense, does not contradict 46:15 and does not go against the weight of obstetrical evidence that makes giving birth one of the most dangerous things a woman can do in her life. (In <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mozambique</st1:place></st1:country-region>, childbirth is the seventh most common cause of death in women, and worldwide a woman dies in labour every 53 seconds.) The Biblical teaching that women give birth with much pain (Genesis 3:16) is far more realistic. </font></font></span></p>

Later he became a companion of the Prophet Muhammed himself, and according to the Muslim medical traditions Muhammed actually sought medical advice from him [40]. He may even have been a relative of the Prophet and his &quot;teachings undoubtedly influenced the latter&quot; [i.e., Muhammed] [41]. &quot;Such medical knowledge as Muhammed possessed, he may well have acquired from Haris bin Kalda [<i>sic</i>], an Arab, who is said to have left the desert for a while and gone to Jundi Shapur to study medicine...On his return Haris settled in Mecca and became the foremost physician of the Arabs of the desert.

Perhaps he recognised that the Qur'an had human sources for some of its stories? As a result of this Muhammed became his sworn enemy, and the Prophet put him to death following his capture in the Battle of Badr in 624 [39].</font></font></span></p>

Thus, with the one as well as the other, we easily recognize the traces of Greek (medicine).&quot; [44] To summarise: Sergius died about the time that Chosroes the Great began his reign, and may even have been employed by Chosroes to translate Galen from Greek into Syriac. Halfway through his reign Chosroes founded Jundishapur, where Galen's manuscripts must surely have been kept in translation. Towards the end of his reign he had an audience with Harith Ibn Kalada, who later became associated with Muhammed.</font></font></span></p>

In the 9th century Hunain Ibn Ishaq (AD 809-873) made perhaps the definitive Arabic translation of Hippocrates and Galen [46], [47], [48] and al-Kindi wrote over twenty medical treatises, including one specifically on Hippocrates.</font></font></span></p>

For example, one of the earliest Arabic compendiums of medicine is Ali at-Tabari's &quot;Paradise of Wisdom&quot; [49], [50], written by a Christian convert to Islam in about 850 at Samarra in Mesopotamia. In it he said that he was following the rules set down by Hippocrates and Aristotle regarding how to write his treatise. It contains 360 chapters, and the fourth Discourse, beginning at chapter 325 is entitled &quot;From the Summaries of Indian Books&quot;. Chapter 330, from Sushrata, &quot;The Genesis of the Embryo and of the Members&quot; claims that the embryo results from mixing of sperm and menstrual blood (<i>vis-a-vis</i> Aristotle!) and describes various constituents of the embryo. The medical historian Arthur Meyer summed up the whole of the Arabic embryological tradition when he said that at-Tabari &quot;depended largely upon Greek sources, which would seem to imply that he could obtain little from the Arabs. Moreover, since Aristotelian and Galenical teaching survived side by side for over a thousand years without a known Arabic counterpart, it is doubtful if the latter existed&quot; [51].</font></font></span></p>

He is trying to convince readers that the Prophet (pbuh) could have come into contact with the views of Galen and so copied him in the Quran, yet because we have already established that the Quranic description of embryological development is markedly and profoundly different to that of Galen, his musings are of now consequence. The Quran is not copied from Greek sources since it's ideas are totally distinct from those found in these sources, the critic playing 'Dr Watson' and using any report he can to try to prove that the Prophet (pbuh) was in contact with people who could have supplied him with material from these sources is therefore absolutely and utterly pointless, irrelevant and unconvincing. In his ramblings the critic also misrepresents aspects of the Prophet's life, but since this is not the point of the present article I will restrict myself to correcting one of the critics interpretations of one such event.

The Islamic edition of his textbook is not available even in the British Library or the US Library of Congress, let alone other medical libraries in Western countries [54], presumably because he is aware that not only do the Islamic contributions in it contradict known science, but they also contradict what he has written in the standard version of his textbook. And ironically in the bibliography for the first chapter, &quot;A history of embryology&quot;, in both the standard and Islamic versions he refers to <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Needham</st1:place></st1:city>'s important work on the history of embryology [55]. <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Needham</st1:place></st1:city> however is unimpressed with the Arabic claims of embryology and after writing almost 60 pages about ancient Greek, Indian and Egyptian embryology he dismisses the entire Arabic tradition in less than one page, concluding that &quot;Arabic science, so justly famed for its successes in certain fields such as optics and astronomy, was not of great help to embryology&quot;. After listing some of the verses in the Qur'an about embryology he dismisses them as merely &quot;a seventh-century echo of Aristotle and the Ayer-veda&quot; [56], in other words a mixture of Greek and ancient Indian teachings. In the most recent (1998) edition of <i>The Developing Human</i>, Moore also directs his readers to a book which contains another essay by Basim Musallam, which again points out how similar the Qur'anic science of embryology was to that of Galen, and how this close association was never questioned by the ancient Muslim scholars [57].</font></font></span></p>

Morever, much of what the Qur'an actually does say about embryology is scientifically inaccurate. The ancient physicians' works were translated into Syriac in the century preceeding Muhammed, and were therefore accessible to non-Greek speakers. We know that one of the Companions of the Prophet was a doctor who trained at the very same medical school that the Greek translations were kept and taught at. We even know that at least one of the verses which describes embryology, sura 23:14 contains the words of another of Muhammed's companions. We are forced to conclude that, far from proving the alleged divine credentials of the Qur'an, its embryological statements actually provide further convincing evidence for its human origins.</span></font></font></p>

If Dr Moore was really so unconvinced about the scientific facts described by the Quran he would have never agreed for these texts to be available in the referred libraries-even after November 1996! In any case even if Dr Moore has been hesitant to share his views with the scientific establishment it's not hard to understand why, since he knows full well that he is very likely to be treated with contempt for even referring to religion in a scientific context in that community. This would have been the case if Dr Moore were trying to prove the scientific accuracy of the Bible or any other text, and just the same as that of the Quran. Also, simply because Dr Moore has 'directed' readers to works that disagree with his views does not mean he supports everything those sources say! The critic has taken a huge leap of logic in making the assumption that referring to something means you agree with everything that it says. As such <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moore</st1:place></st1:city>'s references to the work of Needham etc do not prove anything at all. In conclusion, the Quran contains numerous statements relating to modern embryology that do not in any way resemble the observations of Greek and Indian physicians, not does it contain any statements that are scientifically inaccurate. The miraculous descriptions of the embryo at a time before microscopes were invented still remain an inexplicable miracle, which can only be explained if we accept the ultimate reality of existence- that the Quran is the word of God. The critic has made many logical errors in his research and has failed in disproving the scientific accuracy of the Holy Quran and in linking it to human sources. The main flaws in his article can be summarised as follows:</font></p>
