<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>All Praise is due to Allah, who has no partners, Peace and Blessings be upon His Final Messenger, Muhammad, and upon his family and companions. Am√Æn! </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>What follows is the paper based on the debate between Mr A. Green and J. Smith at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">South</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Bank</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> on Wednesday, 29 May 1996. There apparently seemed to be some confusion by the Christian contingent about the title of the debate, which they seemed to think was "Is the Qur'an the Word of God". However, it has always been very clear from the first invitation to Jay Smith for this debate, that the title was "The Sources of Islam", and the subject matter was to be the various papers written by J. Smith on his external historical critique of Islam. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The writers of this paper assume readers to be familiar with Smith's material, so for the most part do not give details on Smith's arguments within the paper. </FONT></P>
<H2 style="MARGIN: auto 0in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt"><FONT face="Times New Roman">To Be or Not to Be Authentic? That is the Question</FONT></SPAN></H2>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The first thing that we need to clarify is the issues at stake. The primary question we intend to address is the authenticity of the sources upon which the religion of Islam is derived. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>There can be no doubt of the importance of the authenticity of any give religious scripture. This is because once a text has shown to have been corrupted and altered in order to make it comply with doctrinal or political expediencies and if there is no reliable means to distinguish the corrupt from the pure, then there is not one passage of that text that cannot be called into question. This is not so easy with a pure and preserved text. This is well understood by the Christian fundamentalists. If it is not the Word of God, then what real value does it posses as guidance, except as a collection of wisdoms? </FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>How, therefore is the authenticity of any given text, or texts to be established. The fact is that the methodology used and accepted by Islam and the Muslims is historically different from those used by modern Biblical criticism. It must be remembered that the historical and political circumstances that brought about the rise of modern Biblical criticism are unique to that collection of books and the religion of Christianity that claims to be based on it. To demand that the text of Islam should be subjected to the same type of criticism is somewhat fallacious. The very aspects that made the Bible open to criticism in the first place; internal and external contradiction, the variation between numerous documents and the complete lack of means to verify the validity of the Biblical texts as contemporaneous to the events they describe, and the growing realization that the Biblical cannon was something that developed in the context of other Christological traditions, none of which seemed to offer any more of a supportable claim to truth than the other, except that the Pauline tradition was that which managed to dominate, are not present in the Qur'an and the histography of Islam. It is noteworthy that the Biblical criticism is something that grew up from within the Christian tradition after some one thousand five hundred years. Muslim had developed a critical apparatus within the earliest years of its history. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>In the most direct sense the source of Islam is none other that the Creator of the heavens and the earth, the Mighty the Powerful, the Wise, Allah. He is sufficient as a witness to truth of His religion. As a nation we believe that Islam proves itself to be the true religion revealed by Allah for the benefit of all mankind. This proof is composed of several different categories of evidence. We do not intend to go into them here. However these evidences lead the believer in them to the conclusion that the religion of Islam is the true religion of Allah, and thus what the Qur'an, the actual Word of God, and its explanation, the divinely guided Prophetic example, is true and correct. Since the Qur'an itself states that: </FONT></P>

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The believer accepts as a fact that both the Qur'an and its explanation the <SPAN class=em3>Sunnah </SPAN>have been preserved. This is a fact even if we were to accept Smith's claims of a second century compilation the reality of its undisputed preservation without any deviation or difference throughout the whole Muslim world is without doubt remarkable. It is certainly not something the Bible can claim. To the believer the issue might be a rather different one, i.e. how or through what means did Allah cause His religion to be preserved? This is ultimately all that we are obliged to answer. We do not feel that it is necessary to prove Islam's authenticity through another criterion that someone else might wish to set up. The Qur'an speaks of similar challenges to the Prophethood of Muhammad by the pagan Arabs: </FONT></P>

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The Prophet himself would have liked to have met their demands, and this was from his love and concern for his people, and his great desire for them to be guided. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>In the light of the manners of he whom Allah endowed with the best of manners, and seeking to follow the way of him whose way is the best, we shall try to provide them with that which they ask, but with the understanding that what Allah has provided is more than enough for those who are sincere. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>In this context an examination of the type of proof that Smith is demanding leads to the conclusion that it in fact proves nothing. To give an example, if we were to discover an ancient copy of Homer's Iliad, some contemporaneous non-Greek sources, plus architectural evidence, would that mean that Achilles actually was the son of a god, that we should start to worship him, and Zeus and Aphrodite, or similarly with Krishna and Baghavad Gita, or Buddha, etc., . . . Furthermore, even if we do not have what Smith demands it does not prove that it is not the truth, just as the Prophet Mohammed's inability to bring a house of gold or ascend up a ladder into the sky does not prove that he was not a Prophet. In fact what is really exposed by these demands is the incorrect understanding and methodology and aims of the contenders. </FONT></P>
<H2 style="MARGIN: auto 0in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt"><FONT face="Times New Roman">Facts or Fictions</FONT></SPAN></H2>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>An important issue to understand for the unwary travelers through this unfamiliar territory is the context of these ideas, conjectures and theories that Smith declares as historical facts. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>It truly seems that the writing of some of these new historians like Wansbrough, Crone and Cook, who's ideas have been adopted by Rippin, and now Smith, is an attempt to drag Islam into the same quagmire that Christianity finds itself in by attempting to attribute the problems from which the Bible and Christianity suffers onto the Qur'an and Islam. They have, of course failed. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The ideas of Crone and Cook have <SPAN class=em2>not </SPAN>succeeded in winning support from other Western scholars let alone the Muslims. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>In this context it might be helpful to briefly explain the nature of Western scholarship as opposed to what we are used to in Islam. A scholar in the West is expected to arrive at novel or even radical new approaches to a subject, or at least to contribute significantly to a previous theory. It is quite acceptable, nay in their opinion even desirable, to propound and defend even the most incredulous ideas and feel they quite free to ignore evidence that contradicts their ideas. There was, for example, a well respected scholar of Christianity, who was even a member of the elite group of scholars put in charge of the translation of the <st1:place w:st="on">Dead Sea</st1:place> scrolls, who propounded a theory that Jesus was in fact a member of an ancient magic mushroom cult! Merely repeating previously accepted notions is not considered "scholarship." </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Humphrey's writes about Crone and Cooks book <SPAN class=em3>Hagarism </SPAN>that it should be viewed as a <SPAN class=em3>'what-if' </SPAN>exercise rather than a research monograph. R. B. Sergeant writing in <SPAN class=em3>The Journal of Royal Asiatic Society </SPAN>complains about having to plod through "<SPAN class=em3>this tiresome travesty of history</SPAN>." We rather share his sentiments, not only on this issue, but also the whole mass of J. Smith's tiresome lies and distortions. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>There is little doubt that the likes of Smith are aware of the facts, and the weakness of the Wansbrough/Crone and Cook school, yet in his papers he consistently refers to their ideas and speculative conclusions as established history. </FONT></P>
<H2 style="MARGIN: auto 0in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt"><FONT face="Times New Roman">(Orientalism and Evangelism)</FONT></SPAN></H2>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>We should have no doubt that the origins of Orientalism are anything but friendly or even impartial attempts to assess the religion of Islam. Orientalism has its roots firmly grounded in a colonial past and neo-colonialist present. It was always intended to undermine the Muslims adherence to their religion, and make easier the task of ruling the Muslim lands. The works of Orientalists, far from being objective scientific studies are often wrought with prejudice. As one writer states, whilst giving examples of Orientalism's "<SPAN class=em3>more obnoxious representatives": "One of the best examples of contemporary Islamophobic Orientalism is in Hagarism: the Making of the Islamic World</SPAN>, by Patricia Crone and Michael Cook." (Sardar and Davies, Distorted Imagination) </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>When this prejudice is combined with the interests of Christian missionary activities we can dismiss completely any resemblance of impartiality and honesty. Fundamentalist Evangelical Christian Missionaries with whom J. Smith is involved. It seems they have only the slightest hesitation in deceiving and telling outright lies. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Indeed this is not something surprising after having been taught this unscrupulous doctrine by their predecessor in deception, namely Paul, who we find declaring: "<SPAN class=em3> If through my falsehood God's truthfulness abounds to His glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner</SPAN>." (Romans 3:7), thereby disregarding and contradicting his own book where we read: "<SPAN class=em3>A faithful witness does not lie, but a false witness breathes out lies</SPAN>." (Proverbs 14:5). </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>All this rather reminds us of the type of techniques used amongst the poor and starving Muslims of Africa and <st1:place w:st="on">Asia</st1:place>. There are reported incidents of Christian Missionaries giving ill and suffering people infected water to drink "<SPAN class=em3>In the name of Mohammed</SPAN>" and after their illness worsens they give them proper medicine to take "<SPAN class=em3>In the name of Jesus</SPAN>." </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The history of Orientalism is hardly one of unbiased examination of the sources of Islam especially when under the influence of the bigotry of Christianity. From the fanatical distortions of John of Damascus to the apologetic of later writers against Islam, that told their audiences that the Muslims worshipped three idols! Peter the Venerable (1084-1156) "translated" the Qur'an which was used throughout the Middle Ages and contained<SPAN class=em2> nine additional chapters</SPAN>. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Sale</st1:place></st1:City>'s infamously distorted translation followed that trend, and his, along with the likes of Rodwell, Muir and a multitude of others attacked the character and personality of Muhammad. Often they employed invented stories, or narration's which the Muslims themselves considered fabricated or weak, or else they distorted the facts by claiming Muslims held a position which they did not, or using the habits practiced out of ignorance among the Muslims as the accurate portrayal of Islam. As Norman Daniel tell us in his work Islam and the West: <SPAN class=generalquote>"The use of false evidence to attack Islam was all but universal . . . " (p. 267) </SPAN>Smith's papers are replete with examples of this type of approach. Muslim scholars and apologists have more than effectively refuted this outpouring of lies and abuse. The fact that Smith has resorted to the approach of Crone, Cook and Wansbrough is rather indicative of the effectiveness of the Muslim counter arguments. </FONT></P>

His reliance on them is due to the simple fact that they are the only ones who ascribe themselves to these theories. Although it could never be assumed that credit could be given to Smith for concocting such strange theories, it would be hoped that his approach would be reflective of his mentors. One will sadly find it is not. This is not to say that he is totally autonomous from the many mistakes and absurd assumptions (to be discussed later) carried in the work of Wansbrough, Crone and Cook, this is without doubt clearly apparent. The difference lies in Smith's deep ignorance of the subject matter he is involved in. One cannot deny the astounding scholastic levels reached by the likes of Wansbrough.

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The whole approach leaves established methods of Islamic historical analysis for methods which are so defective that at times they cause the authors themselves to abandon them for conventional ones. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>What Wansbrough, Crone and Cook can be acknowledged for, and this illustrates the immense difference between them and the contemporary minion Smith is the following; Firstly, analyzing history through one's own criteria cannot cause a problem when all one is interested in is expressing one's opinions. This is illustrated perfectly in Wansbrough's own confession about the "conjectural nature" of his work and calls his analysis "strictly experimental" and the "emphatically tentative" nature of his conclusions (QS xi, SM, x). Secondly, if one starts from a position of an already fixed theory, and then looks for evidence to fit that theory, then obviously this is all the evidence one will have acquired. How many times does Smith echo the words: "<SPAN class=em3>There is no evidence for . . . </SPAN>", "<SPAN class=em3> There is no mention of . . . </SPAN>"? </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>There is no evidence, obviously because the writers didn't want the evidence. Again Crone and Cook are happy to admit this. In the preface to the book Hagarism, Crone and Cook tell us that they intend to ignore a rock inscription dated from the mid 600's with the phrase "<SPAN class=em3>AHL AL ISL<SPAN lang=AR-SA dir=rtl>√Ç</SPAN>M </SPAN>". They then carry on in the book to inform that the words <SPAN class=em3>MUSLIM </SPAN>and <SPAN class=em3>ISL<SPAN lang=AR-SA dir=rtl>√Ç</SPAN>M </SPAN>appeared in the late 700's!!! </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>It is in attempting to present this viewpoint as fact, something which his sources would not claim for an instance, that Smith reveals his ignorance and total incomprehension of the very material proffered as the foundation of his theories. If Smith feels that he has uncovered areas which appear to be unanswerable by Muslims due to their apparent ignorance of the questions that are raised then this is accepted. Muslims don't know and do not need to know of the interpretations of any of these so called academics. Crone and Cook tell us this themselves; </FONT></P>

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Smith is himself a proof of these very phenomena. We find his work replete with misunderstandings, errors and misinformation concerning Islam. Incredibly simple mistakes are made, such as the Muslim's five prayers all being in the day, and his mentioning the six<SPAN class=em3> beliefs of Im√¢n</SPAN>. Even in his paper on the topic of the sources of Islam he misunderstands the significance of different genres, he claims the Qur'an is the "<SPAN class=generalquote> mother of the books </SPAN>" whereas in-fact the "<SPAN class=em3> mother of the books </SPAN>" are the preserved tablets in which everything is written concerning the beginning of creation to the end. He also mentions that Muhammad's cousin was Waraka, when in fact it was his wife Khad√Æja's cousin, and that "even Muslim sources state" he was a Catholic, and that Bahira was a Nestorian, whereas in fact Muslim sources say nothing of the sort. This was the propaganda of the medieval polemicists like John of Damascus. In fact Smith is so confused that he contradicts himself later on the same issue. Now if this is the case of someone who has a degree in Islamic studies, how about someone less informed? The fact is that these sources are not only likely to be replete with ignorant statements, but also with outright lies and distortions. Are we to believe, for example, that because Peter the Venerable added nine chapters to his "translation" of the Qur'an, that in fact the Qur'an at that time did have nine more chapters, and that the Muslim sources that report otherwise are not to be trusted, or for example, that Joseph Smith's words are more likely to be trusted in respect to information about Islam than these. </FONT></P>

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Having already examined the problems of using non-Muslim sources let us take a more in-depth examination of some of the conclusions Smith draws concerning the information contained in them. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Firstly, Smith talks of a papyrus dated 643CE (21AH) which speaks of the year twenty-two, suggesting something happened among the Arabs which coincides with the year of Hijra. Well there you go! Why does he expect us to presume that it was anything other than that? We are not told what the Nestorian ecclesiastical documents from 676CE (54AH) and 680CE (58AH) actually say. If it talks about the "exodus" of Arabs to the "Promised Land" then this is simply the language familiar to them, and cannot be construed to mean that the Arabs considered themselves to be partaking in an "Exodus", and that they considered Jerusalem to be their "promised land." Smith's use of the tradition in the Sunan of Abu Dawood stating that "there will be Hijra after the Hijra, but the best Hijra is that of Abraham" proves absolutely nothing. First the word Hijra is not the same as the word exodus. Hijra simply means to leave one thing, or place for another. The "best" Hijra is explained in another Prophetic narration: "The best of those who perform Hijra are those who abandon that which Allah has prohibited and the best jihad is the one who strives against his own self for the sake of Allah the Mighty and Majestic." (at-Tabaranee in al Kabir) So this is the Hijra of Abraham, the khalil of Allah, who abandoned disobedience for obedience to Allah. All this data rather confirms exactly what the Muslim sources say. Now Smith tries to support this nothing with more nothing. </FONT></P>
<H2 style="MARGIN: auto 0in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt"><FONT face="Times New Roman">Qibla</FONT></SPAN></H2>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Smith claims that archaeological evidence points to mosques that are not aligned towards Makkah. Now what does this prove? In order to give any credibility to his theory he needs to show a consistent pattern of mosques pointing towards <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:place></st1:City>, but what he shows us is a selection of mosques pointing in a number of different directions. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>It is quite noteworthy how unreliably archaeology can be. During a cursory glance through one of the internet sights that cover the Dead Sea Scrolls, one particular page was talking about the archaeological findings on the <st1:place w:st="on">Qumran</st1:place> site. It mentioned that concerning the building, opinions differed as to whether it was a garrison, fort and military installation, a monastery, or a palace. The so called archaeological excavations of Father DeVaux claimed to have discovered a scriptorium, which conveniently fitted his theories. However an impartial archaeological team from <st1:place w:st="on">Scandinavia</st1:place> actually discovered it was not a scriptorium at all but a dinning hall. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>This is what Creswell says concerning early mosques: <SPAN class=generalquote>".their architectural resources, before they started in their career of conquest, were barely enough to give expression to their needs. In other words Arabia constituted an almost perfect architectural vacuum . . . The first mosques in the great hiras, or half nomadic encampments of the conquest, such as Basra, K√ªfa and Fustat, were primitive in the extreme, and in Syria the first mosques were churches that had been converted or merely divided: in fact there is no reason for believing that any mosque was built as such in Syria unto the time of Al Walid or possibly Abdal M√¢lik, For over a generation the Arabs remained quite untouched by any architectural ambitions. "</SPAN>It is worth noting that the Prophet disliked extravagance and impressive architecture in buildings, especially mosques. The relative simplicity of early mosques is in fact a historical example of how the Prophet's Companions diligently followed his wishes. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Let us now turn our attention to the direction of these mosques. In the face of what Creswell says we wonder how exactly archaeologists determined that their discoveries were indeed mosques and how they decided in which direction the Qibla was. It is noteworthy that the use of the mihrab did not appear until its introduction by Coptic workers who were expanding the Prophet's mosque in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Medina</st1:place></st1:City> (88AH) and placed a mihrab there. This mihrab still exists. The Prophet's mosque is one of many examples of early mosques facing Makkah, as is the "<SPAN class=em3>mosque of the two Qiblas </SPAN>" in which the Prophet was praying while Allah revealed the command to change the Qibla from <st1:City w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:City> to Makkah, and also the Quba mosque in the outskirts of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Medina</st1:City></st1:place> which also still exists. Creswell gives further examples of early mosques that were converted from churches which contradict Smith's conclusions: </FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>"In the first two centuries of Islam, when mosques were being built from Andalusia to <st1:place w:st="on">Central Asia</st1:place>, the Muslims had no truly scientific means of finding the Qibla. Clearly they knew roughly the direction they had taken to reach wherever they were, and the direction of the road in which pilgrims left for <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mecca</st1:place></st1:City> could be, and in some cases actually was, used as a Qibla. But they also followed two basic procedures, observing tradition and developing a simple expedient. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>In the first case, some authorities observed the Prophet Mohammed had prayed due south when he was in <st1:City w:st="on">Medina</st1:City> (north of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mecca</st1:place></st1:City>) and they advocated the general adoption if this direction for the Qibla. This explains why many early mosques from Andalusia to <st1:place w:st="on">Central Asia</st1:place> face south. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Other authorities held that the Qur'an required one to stand precisely so that one faced the Ka'ba. Now the Muslims of Meccan origin knew the when they were standing in front of the walls or corners of the Ka'ba they were facing directions specifically associated with the rising's and settings of the sun and certain fixed stars. The major axis of the rectangular base of the edifice is said to point towards the rising point of Canopus, and the minor axis is said to point to summer sunrise and winter sunset. These assertions about the Ka'ba's astronomical alignments, found in newly-discovered medieval sources, and have been confirmed by modern measurements . . . </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>. . . The corners of the Ka'ba were associated even in pre-Islamic times with the four main regions of the surrounding world, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Syria</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region>, for example, one should stand in the same direction as if one were standing right in front of the north-eastern wall of the Ka'ba. Thus the first Muslims in Iraq built their mosques with the prayer walls towards winter sunset because they wanted the mosques to face the north-eastern wall of the Ka'ba, Like wise the first mosques in Egypt were built with their prayer walls facing winter sunrise so that the prayer hall was parallel to the not-eastern wall of the Ka'ba. Inevitably there were differences of opinion, and different directions were favoured by particular groups. Indeed, in each major region of the Islamic World, there was a whole spectrum of directions used for the Qibla. Only rarely do the orientations of medieval mosques correspond to the Qiblas derived by computation. Recently some medieval texts have been identified which deal with the problem of the Qibla in Andalusia, the Maghrib, Egypt, Iraq and Iran, and Central Asia, Their study has done much to clarify the orientation of mosques in these areas.

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Here Smith introduces one of his favoured techniques, a technique which we find replete throughout his papers, and that is attributing a belief to the Muslims which they do not hold and then proceeding to refute it. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Smith tells us that "<SPAN class=em3>Muslims maintain that <st1:City w:st="on">Mecca</st1:City> was not only a great and ancient city, but it was, as well the centre of the trading routes for <st1:place w:st="on">Arabia</st1:place> in the seventh century and before</SPAN>." Having checked the famous Tafs√Ær's of Ibn Kath√Ær, Tabari and Qurtubi, there is no mention of this at all. Nor indeed is there any such claim in Guilleme's translation of the Seerah of Ibn Ishaak. Indeed the Qur'an calls Makkah "<SPAN class=em3>Umm ul-Qur√¢ </SPAN>", literally translated as the "Mother of the Settlements", not the "<SPAN class=em3>Mother of all Settlements</SPAN>.". But the meaning is not that which Smith assigns to it. Tabari explains that "<SPAN class=em3>Umm ul-Qur√¢ </SPAN>" means the centre of settlements in and around Makkah. Ibn Ishaak's Seerah further explains this as the place where the sons of Ishmael spread out from into the surrounding areas. Ibn Katheer mentions the building of the Ka'ba by Adam, but this is not an authentic story, however we find that he attributes the following Had√Æth to the Prophet,"<SPAN class=haithquote> Makkah is the most beloved place to me and the most beloved place to Allah</SPAN>." The importance of Makkah lies in the fact of its containing the first House raised for the worship of Allah alone, al Ka'ba, and thus the settlement (not city) that grew up around it was primarily for the worship of Allah alone, and this indeed reflects the very purpose for which mankind has been created. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Indeed we must agree that <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Mecca</st1:City></st1:place> is situated in a barren valley, as the Qur'an itself mentions the supplication of Abraham as saying this, leaving his firstborn Ishmael there. Nothing has greatly changed. Mecca until this day could hardly be described a great city, or the centre of trade, but the fact is that every year millions of people go there for essentially one purpose, and that is to worship the one true God, Allah, the One free of all imperfections. It is this that was then the primary attraction of Makkah, that caused this far away barren place to even come to be mentioned by Ptolomy. In fact it seems he is not the only ancient historian to have mentioned Makkah, for according to Thomas Carlyle, Sisus who lived 70BC, stated that Makkah was the greatest centre of pilgrimage in the whole world and the oldest (Thomas Carlyle,..Heroes and Hero Worship). So it is on the religious dimension that Makkah is made important. Crone and Cook's question as to why such a barren place should be considered so important, whilst Taieef, with plentiful water and greenery and even a sanctuary, was close by is in fact a proof of the high standing of Makkah amongst the Arabs. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>"What commodity was available in Arabia that could be transported such an inhospitable environment, and still be sold at a profit large enough to support the growth of a city in a periphera; site bereft of natural resources" So we will ask exactly the same question about Mecca today: what commodity brings five million people every year from every corner of the world to the inhospitable, barren, inaccessible valley? Truly: "la illah il Allah." </FONT></P>

The Meccan's were able to organise the trade so that each tribe gained more from co-operating with caravans traversing its territory that if stood to gain from raiding the caravans and thereby depressing the total volume of trade, To do this, however, Mecca had to fight the Fijar war with an important neighbouring tribe. That all of this should have been accomplished in such a short space of time clearly shows that control of trade was a specific goal of the Quraish. Their selection of <st1:City w:st="on">Mecca</st1:City> as the site for their settlement, while influenced, certainly, by the religious shrine there . . . was primarily dictated by the need to dominate and as far as possible from potential sources of imperial interference in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Syria</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Yemen</st1:place></st1:country-region>." </FONT></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The answer is, the cancer of humanity: usury.

First because the Qur'an does not contain any dates, and secondly Muhammad never severed his ties with the Jews (see Constitution of Medina) except those who had betrayed the fledgling state at Medina during the Battle of the Ditch, and others who acted treacherously, and even then he (peace be upon him) treated them with the utmost leniency. It was only on the Prophet's death bead that he ordered that no two religions should remain in the Hij√¢z, but this order was applicable to both Jews and Christians. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>As for the<SPAN class=em3> Doctrina Iacobi</SPAN>, all that this says is that this Jewish convert will not renounce his beliefs even if the Jews and Saracens catch him and cut him to pieces. Now you could understand a number of different things from this, but is by no means evidence that the Jews and Saracens worked hand in hand, or were part of a unified force. What has to be remembered when we examine these documents is the prevailing atmosphere at the time. Jews, it must be remembered, where hated and despised by all Christians at that time, and then, as now, the anti-Semite was ready to ally the Jews with any possible enemy. The anonymous Armenian chronicler only tells a similar story. It does not prove that this was the fact; rather it only shows us what some of the Christians perceived, or indeed the pure propaganda that they were using. This is one possibility; the other is that they simply perceived Islam as some form of Judaism. There were indeed amongst the Muslims large numbers of Arab Jews who had reverted to Islam, and the idea of a right to the Holy Land is also understood in the context of the fact that the Prophet Muhammad had prophesied that the Muslims would conquer Sham. If one was to examine these sources in this light we would see confirmation of Islamic histography, not a contradiction of it. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>What is more telling is how Smith has completely ignored that piece of evidence (from non-Muslim writers) that without doubt supports what the Islamic sources tell us, namely John of Damascus! </FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Smith says: <SPAN class=generalquote>"Other Muslim scholars maintain that a further reason for the absence of early documentation can be blamed on old age. They believe that the material upon which the primary sources were written disintegrated over time, leaving us with few examples."</SPAN> </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman">In order to refute his own argument (he doesn't mention any Muslim scholars who made this claim), Smith refers the reader to early Christian documents which have survived and were compiled well before early Islamic material. However, it is amazing to see that Smith points only to 'secondary' Christian artefacts (Codex Syniaticus and Alexandrinus) which are dated over four centuries after the advent of Christianity. Why does he not mention any 'primary' documents which are earlier than this, because if he had they would only have strengthened his argument? The fact is that he has no primary sources to refer to. We assume he would have wanted Muslims to write their books on materials similar to those used for early Christian documents about which we read: "<SPAN class=generalquote>The original copies of the New Testament books have, of course, long since disappeared. This fact should not cause surprise. In the first place, they were written on papyrus, a very fragile and perishable material."

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Can we really excuse Smith for making foolish claims about the supposed absence of early documentation? After all he has positioned himself as somewhat of an authority - or father figure - amongst his Christian peers. Alas, if only they knew how absurd his claims sound to an informed ear. One doesn't even need to accept the view's of biased Muslims, apparently so ready to ascribe anything to their Prophet without a question of authenticity. Are one's eyes and ears closed and sealed to the work of many Orientalists who have documented and published very early Muslim documentation. How about Hasan al Basri's Qadar letter to 'Abd al-M√¢lik, which according to some must have been written before 110AH? And what about <SPAN class=em3>al Alim wa' l-muta'allim </SPAN>and <SPAN class=em3>Risala ila Uthman al Batti </SPAN>both ascribed to Abu Hanifa (d.150). Or even the manuscripts published by Van Ess, a Radd ala 'l-Qadariyya attributed to al Hasan b. Muhammad b. Al Hanafiya, Ali's grandson, died between 86 and 100 AH, and a Risala of Umar ibn Abdul Aziz (d.101AH) in which he refutes the Qadarites? All the above mentioned manuscripts abound in Qur'anic quotations, which present no textual variants, putting to rest equally absurd claims about the collation of the Qur'anic text. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The final deadly blow in this one sided war against a weak and ill-equipped enemy comes from an extremely strange quarter. It is the legacy of one who was the fountain of all Christian polemic, namely the Christian hero, John of Damascus (to be disregarded and thrown to the dogs by his latter day minions?). Born in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Damascus</st1:City></st1:place> in the year 675 (i.e. 22AH), he was later regarded as the first Christian authority on Islam. His tract <SPAN class=em3>De Haeresbius </SPAN>became the 'armory for all future controversial writings against Islam'. [J. W. Voorhis,<SPAN class=em3> John of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Damascus</st1:place></st1:City></SPAN>]. John held in his book that the Qur'an was not revealed, but created. He attempted to discredit the Prophet Muhammad by spreading false rumors that a Christian monk, Bahira, had helped in the creation of the Qur'an. John also labeled Arabs as "Saracens" from a Jewish name, (ibid). The "Saracens" became the common name by which they were referred to in the early literature on Islam in the West. So what was he writing about? A Qur'an which wasn't compiled? A Prophet which didn't exist? A religion that had not yet been formulated? In this, finally, John of Damascus has given some real guidance to his Christian progeny. </FONT></P>

Smith is so emphatically insistent that any documentation that is provided must be checked, tested, burnt, radio-accelerated, and only by a list of people he is comfortable with. If this list includes his grandmother, then that is what must be done before he is willing to offer his acceptance. The documentation we have provided has been attested by both Muslim and non-Muslim experts as has been mentioned. What Smith is obviously unaware of, and if he had bothered to read anything himself, he would have known, that the documentation he is providing for his own theories have not themselves been attested.

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>In conclusion, we can say that the various non-Muslim sources, even if authentic prove nothing.

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The first point that we need to highlight is that the absence of manuscripts does not prove that the Qur'an in the hands of the Muslims is not the Qur'an that was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. Secondly, the existence of early documentary evidence does not actually prove that these were the words spoken by Muhammad, or indeed any other historical character. Although this is something that a Western historian would like or indeed demand, it is in fact not necessarily that reliable. The Muslims of the earliest generations, including that of the Prophet, indeed the Prophet himself considered writing a useful tool, both of preservation and reference, but it has never been accepted as sufficient in and off itself. An example of this is when Umar ibn al Khatt√¢b was approached by a group of Jews from Khaibar claiming that they had a document from the Prophet guaranteeing their right to stay. Umar rejected it, claiming it was a fake on the basis that it contradicted what was orally transmitted from the Prophet on the issue. This highlights three issues of benefit to our discussion. First the possibility of forgery of a document, even though contemporaneous and secondly the benefit and need for a sound chain of oral transmission, and thirdly that hostile parties certainly do not formulate a more reliable source of information. </FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>To begin with the quote of a Muslim, al-Kalkashandi, he maintains (Kit√¢b al-A'sha 3/p.15) that K√ªfic is said to have been the earliest script from which the others developed, he writes: "The Arabic script (khatt) is the one which is now known as K√ªfic. From it evolved all the present pens." This is a very profound statement as its findings differ greatly from Smith's assertions! Though Nabia Abbott's conclusions perhaps may not go so far as to agree ad totum with this conclusion we find that she does say: " . . . the Muslim tradition that the original Arabic script was K√ªfic (that is, Hiran or Anbaran) is one of those statements which, though known to be half wrong, may yet be half right."

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The terms that came to be applied to these scripts by early Arabs themselves could not have the chronological significance that some later Arabs and most Western writers have put to them.

The fact is that the script which later came to be known as K√ªfic has its origin far earlier than the founding of the town of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">K√ªfah</st1:place></st1:City>. Atiq Siddiqui writes: <SPAN class=generalquote>"The K√ªfic or the angular variety of the Arabic script, has been traced about a hundred years before the foundation of the town K√ªfa, 638CE (AH17) to which place the style owes its name." </SPAN>[Siddiqui, The Story of Islamic Calligraphy, p.9] That is to say, the town was founded in AH17, and the K√ªfic style originated 100 years before that time! Where does this leave Smith's theory?

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Baladhuri's account of the origins and spread of the North Arabic script [Futuh al-Buldaan, pp.471-74] points, as do other sources, to Hirah as the seat of the North Arabic script by the close of the 5th century. What is of note here is that it is the Hiran (or Anbaran) script which later came to be classified as the K√ªfic. Abbott writes: "<SPAN class=generalquote>. . . K√ªfah and Basrah did not start their careers as Muslim cities until the second decade of Islam But these cities were located closer to Anbar and Hirah in Irak, K√ªfah being but a few miles south of Hirah. We have already seen the major role the two earlier cities played in the evolution of Arabic writing, and it is but natural to expect them to have developed a characteristic script to which the newer cities of K√ªfah and Basrah fell heir, so that for K√ªfic and Basran script one is tempted to substitute Anbaran and Hiran . . . our study so far shows that the script of Hirah must have been the leading script in the 6th century and as such must have influenced all later scripts, including the Makkan - Madinan</SPAN>."

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The city of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">K√ªfah</st1:place></st1:City> therefore inherited and took on the script which was already prevailing in Hirah.

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Baladhuri states further that Bishr ibn Abdul-M√¢lik, a Christian, used to frequent Hirah, where he learned to write Arabic. Later Bishr came to Makkah and taught the writing there. Abbott in discussing the Makkan, Madinan, K√ªfic and Basran scripts highlights that: " <SPAN class=generalquote>. . . one need hardly expect any spectacular variations in the scripts of these four leading cities, for as we have already seen, increased activities in writing in Makkah and Madinah date from the days of Bishr (note: approx 500CE), who avowedly taught the script he had himself learned in Hirah. Thus a fundamental similarity of the four scripts is to be expected." </SPAN>[Abbott, ibid, p.18] </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The use, therefore, of a script which was later recognised as K√ªfic in the Hij√¢z during the time of the Prophet and after is no surprise since Bishr, who himself had learnt this script from its point of origin in Hirah, had already begun to teach it in the Hij√¢z some 100 years earlier! </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Smith also argues that it is the view of both Martin Lings and Yasin Safadi that the K√ªfic script 'did not appear until late into the eighth century (790's and later)'. It is difficult to see how this view can be ascribed to Safadi, because he himself, in his work <SPAN class=em3>Islamic Calligraphy </SPAN>(p.11), details the tombstone from the period of the Caliph Abdal-M√¢lik (see above) which he describes as being in the K√ªfic script. This is a minimum of 80 years before the date which Smith ascribes to Safadi. Safadi writes: <SPAN class=generalquote>"The K√ªfic script, which reached perfection in the second half of the eight century . . . "</SPAN>[ibid, p.10]. Can we then assume from this, taking into account the previous evidence that Safadi held the belief that the script first originated at this time? No, rather he is clearly stating that it is here when it reached its 'perfection'. Martin Lings and Safadi again arrive at a similar conclusion for their book in honour of the 1976 Qur'an exhibition at the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">British</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Museum</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> (p.12)! </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Smith is found to be not only incorrect in his dating of the origins of the K√ªfic script, but also erroneous in his opinion that K√ªfic is not a script that we would expect to have been employed in the Hij√¢z during the Caliphate of Uthman. In respect to Lings and Safadi, he has merely misread their claims. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>To conclude, Abbot thinks that the Uthmanic Qur'an's probably were in Makka-Madini scripts <SPAN class=generalquote>" . . . yet when these Qur'ans were written K√ªfa was already in the foreground, and indeed, even before the edition of Uthman was undertaken, prominent K√ªfans were working on a similar, though non-official project.

<H2 style="MARGIN: auto 0in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt"><FONT face="Times New Roman">The Qur'an: Histography</FONT></SPAN></H2>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The first problem that we encounter with the suggestion that the Qur'an was not written until two hundred years after Hijra is that of histography, i.e. what we know of the history of that period makes this an impossibility, most notably the fact that M√¢lik ibn Marwan, and his general Al Hajaj, were fighting against the claim of Caliphate by Abdullah ibn Zubair, whose mother Asma was the sister of Aisha, the wife of Prophet Muhammad. In fact the explanation that Creswell gives for the impressive construction of the Dome of the Rock is because <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mecca</st1:place></st1:City> was under the control of his rival, Abdullah ibn Zubair. It was his attempt, he claims, to set up al Aqsa as an attractive alternative to the Hajj that lead him to construct the Dome. This theory that the Dome of the Rock was given such importance rather works against Smith's ideas. If he proposes that the Qur'an that we have today was compiled and enforced under Al Hajjaj, and he must admit that that same Qur'an calls mankind to make Hajj, to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Mecca</st1:City></st1:place>, and to the house built there by Abraham, for the worship of the one God Allah. This poses a problem. Why would M√¢lik ibn Marw√¢n expend so much time and effort to build the Dome on the Rock and then turn people away from that to Makkah. Furthermore, how would he persuade the people of this empire stretching from Spain to India to make Pilgrimage to a hot, barren, remote, desolate place, the journey to which itself is a danger to life and limb, and which, he is reluctant to admit, contained anything at all of any significance? </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Secondly, if, as Smith asserts, the Qur'an's sophistication is a product of the Arabs contact with other civilizations. More likely than this is that a unsophisticated, primitive people would adopt the religion of their subjects as happened with the Goths and Tartars and each group of Arabs would have developed their own distinct religious tradition according to the land they conquered. Even a successful conqueror such as Alexander and his successors with a strong Macedonian/Greek culture behind him could not resist the lure of adopting the various religions of the various conquered nations. Indeed it would seem unique in history that a primitive nomadic people managed not to get absorbed into the cultures and religions of their respective conquered people, but rather managed to establish their own unique culture and civilization. Smith openly admits this himself in his introduction: </FONT></P>

Another devastating fact that makes the 200 AH compilation theory next to impossible is the existence of various sects, namely the Shi'a and the Khawarij, who trace the origins of their factionalism to the Caliphates of Ali ibn Talib and Muawiya ibn Abu Sufyan. They had every reason to try and prove their claims by referring to their own versions of the Qur'an, but the undeniable fact of their agreement until this day upon a single text of the Qur'an, and their inability to even bring one single different ayaat proves that a standard text had become completely established at a very early stage. These groups would have been the first to exploit any attempt by Hajjaj to compile and introduce a new version, let alone a completely different book.

Both contemporary and traditional Orientalists excluding of course, the present writers, have researched extensively into the collection and codification of the Qur'anic text and the emergent view is unanimous. One recent writer, John Burton, whose book was published at the same time as the work of Crone, Cook and Wansbrough, arrives at precisely the same position regarding the Prophet's direct association with the Qur'an as his preceding learned progenitors.

Schacht (Origins, pp.176-77) criticizes the isn√¢d - M√¢lik from N√¢fi from Ibn Umar on the grounds that M√¢lik was too young at the time of N√¢fi's death, and therefore could not have heard Had√Æth from the latter. It is strange to see that that Schacht says: "<SPAN class=generalquote>Nothing authentic is known of M√¢lik's date of birth</SPAN>". If he believes this then how can he adduce that M√¢lik was too young? </FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>This argument, however, assumes that the reader will not check the facts for himself, for M√¢lik was almost 23 years of age when Naafi died, and was hence in a perfectly good position to study under him, as can be adduced from a study of their respective biographies. </FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>2. Schacht (Origins, pp.36-37) takes the statement of Ibn Sirin that: "<SPAN class=generalquote> They did not ask about the isn√¢d but when the fitna (civil war) occurred they said: 'Name to us your men . . . </SPAN>' . . . " and declares it to be a fabrication on the basis that the civil war referred to in the statement was the one which started with the death of the Umayyad Caliph Wal√Æd bin Yaz√Æd who died in 127AH, whereas Ibn Sir√Æn had already died in 110AH! </FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Schacht's whole argument rests on his arbitrary interpretation of the word fitna (civil war). The death of Wal√Æd bin Yaz√Æd has never been a conventional date in Islamic History. Furthermore, there were many civil wars before this date, which Schacht appears to have overlooked. There was the unrest at the time of the death of the Caliph Uthm√¢n, the rift which occurred between Ali and Mu'√¢wiyah, and that between Ibn az-Zubair and Abd al-M√¢lik bin Marwan, all of which occurred between 40 to 80 years before the death of Ibn Sir√Æn. </FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Schacht takes the word fitna in the sense which suits his preconceived theory, without any historical justification. This, of course, is logically absurd. </FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>3. Schacht (Origins, p.60) says that Ibrah√Æm an-Nakhai confirms certain things by "pointing out the absence of any information on that matter from the Prophet, Abu Bakr and Umar" and Schacht refers to the work of Abu Yusuf, Athar, pp.349-52. Schacht assumes then that the Had√Æth from the Prophet on the matter under discussion must have been fabricated after the time of Ibrahim; otherwise he would not have failed to mention them. This is erroneous for two simple reasons: </FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Firstly, the very reference which Schacht cites, namely, Abu Yusuf, pp.349-52, has explicit statements which contradict his own assertions. Here we find two traditions, both narrated by Ibrah√Æm, describing the practice of the Prophet. </FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Secondly, even if we accept that Ibrah√Æm did not know of any Had√Æth from the Prophet on the subject at hand. Schacht is then guilty of making the absurd assumption that Ibrahim must have known all of the Prophetic Had√Æth on every subject. He fails to take into consideration the obvious possibility that Ibrahim's failure to mention a narration was because he himself was unaware of one and because one did not exist. </FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>4. Schacht (Origins, pp.241-42) in order to support his theory that incomplete and broken isn√¢ds were perfected and completed by later authors gives an example of one such broken isn√¢d from the works of ash-Shafiee which he asserts was corrected and remedied by M√¢lik in his book al-Muwatta. </FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Schacht blatantly reverses the evidence to prove his point. He fails to inform the reader that M√¢lik's book <SPAN class=em3>al-Muwatta </SPAN>was compiled some forty years earlier than ash-Shafiee's. In other words the correct and complete isn√¢d is dated earlier than the one which Schacht quotes as broken. So, according to Professor Schacht, the mistake was remedied before it was ever committed! </FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>It is analysis such as this on the part of Schacht and at times his complete lack of understanding of the source material which has subsequently led Western scholars to express grave doubts about his work.

<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>It is also worth replying here to the comments of other European scholars who have envisaged a natural course of events in which those who associated with the Prophet for a long period would have reported more traditions from him than those who only knew him for a short while. This, however, was not the case. The younger generation of Companions reported far larger numbers of Had√Æth than their older brethren. These questions have already been raised by classical Had√Æth scholars themselves, who point out that since the older Companions passed away not long after the death of the Prophet, they had less time to pass on all the traditions known to them, whereas the younger Companions, such as Ibn Abb√¢s, Abu Hurairah, Aisha, lived for a longer period, and were therefore able to disseminate the narrations known to them much more extensively. This serves as an argument against the accusation of later fabrication as J. Fuch points out, it in fact supports the veracity of the traditionalists; for if all the isn√¢d's had been forged by them, they would have tried to produce isn√¢d's from the older Companions in larger numbers.

First, in my view, Crone has merely replaced one a priori assumption (authenticity) with another (inauthenticity); between these two extreme positions, however, lies much ground for historical investigation . . . in at least one instance Crone has exaggerated an alleged discrepancy between the early jurists and Prophetic Had√Æth. To corroborate her conclusion about the contribution of Near Eastern provincial law to the origins of Islamic law, she attempts to demonstrate conclusively that the legal maxim 'no bequest to an heir' could not have been instituted by the Prophet, as Islamic tradition maintains, because all of the early Iraqi jurists appear to have forgotten what the Prophet allegedly had said (pp.93-6). But her analysis rests upon a clear misreading of the Prophetic Had√Æth, making it appear as if the early jurists disagreed with the Prophet when in fact they did not (for a detailed critique of her argument, see again my article 'On Bequests in Early Islam'). One wonders whether a close examination of other instances in which Crone attributes 'wild disagreement' to the early jurists might not yield similar results. Be that as it may, Crone's inability to demonstrate the inauthenticity of this Prophetic Had√Æth does not inspire confidence in her blanket rejection of the authenticity of all statements attributed to the Prophet." </FONT></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

Smith is somehow under the delusion that 600,000 Had√Æths means 600,000 separate bodies of text! He fails to remember that a Had√Æth consists of both a text (matn) and a chain of transmission (isn√¢d), in the science of Had√Æth the same text with ten chains of transmission is not one Had√Æth but rather ten Had√Æths (despite the fact that the text attached to each chain is the same in every case.) </FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>This increase in the number of Had√Æths included in the later collections is easily fathomed by anyone conversant with the history of the collection of Had√Æth.

It was only after students of Had√Æth had traveled through all these countries and collected together the traditions known to the specialists living there, and narrated them to their own students, that larger and more complete collections of Had√Æth could be compiled. </FONT></P>

We will find that in Bukh√¢r√Æ's generation at least 16 individuals will be hearing the Had√Æth from their respective teachers. Because each individual chain of transmission counts as a separate Had√Æth, what started out as a single narration transmitted by one Companion only, has evolved within a short period of time to 16 Had√Æth's; an increase of 1600%. The true nature of affairs, however, being far greater, with a far greater number of Companions transmitting a far greater number of narrations to a far greater number of students. This then is the form in which proliferation took place, the dispersion of narrators and chains of transmission, not, as Smith seems to think, by the emergence of newly formulated texts! </FONT></P>

Smith would want us to accept that because SOME of the Had√Æth may have doubt concerning them then we should simply discard ALL of the other narrations on the same basis! This is akin to a coinsmith who finds a forgery amidst his pile and promptly proceeds to dispose of the rest of the coins without giving to them the individual scrutiny that they deserve. This would be ludicrous! (Using the same analogy, we could say that Christians should dispose of the four canonized gospels because of the existence of numerous apocryphal gospels!) </FONT></P>

Smith is also under the delusion that nothing exists until it is put into writing. For him the spoken word holds no lasting value whatsoever. The mere compilation of a work at a given time in no way implies that its contents were not available or did not exist well beforehand. Smith says: "...seems to suggest either their creation or their adoption at this time." Which is it going to be: 'creation' or 'adoption'? The first (creation) implies something new and the other (adoption) the acceptance of something already in existence. Smith can't have it both ways. (Medication still absent) </FONT></P>

Schacht was of the view that the law and the practice existed first [Origins, p.63] and were then given an air of authority by linking them to the Prophet! To support his argument he quotes Ibn Qasim from the Mudawwana (4/28) who concludes by saying: "<SPAN class=generalquote>So the traditions remained neither discarded (in principle) nor adopted in practice . . . and actions were ruled by other traditions which were accompanied by practice</SPAN>." </FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Schacht fails to grasp the meaning behind his source.

So, if there were a conflict between these two groups, then the one accompanied by the practice would be given precedence.

<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Smith may be excused here for slipping up in an area where his forefathers were to do the same. Smith has a misconception about isn√¢ds which to him implies solely oral transmission, whereas in many instances a chain of transmission actually comprised of a series of books which were referred to by the name of their author rather than the name of the book itself. The main reason for this assumption is usually due to a misunderstanding of the term - hadathana - (i.e. he narrated/informed to us) which outwardly seems to suggest oral transmission but which was regularly used for the transmission of books also. In some instances a document is referred to directly in the isn√¢d. Take the following four examples: </FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>- In the Musnad (1/418) of Ahmad the isn√¢d: "<SPAN class=generalquote>Yahya bin Adam informed us that Abdullah ibn Idris dictated to him from his book</SPAN>."

<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>- Abu Dawud transmits a portion of the booklet of Samurah in various chapters of his Sunan without mentioning the document but at all times referring to the author and employing the term "<SPAN class=em3>he narrated/informed to us </SPAN>". </FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>- In the Sunan (1/45) of an-Nasa'i the isn√¢d: "<SPAN class=generalquote>Muhammad bin al-Muthnee narrated to us, saying, Ibn Abi Adee narrated to us from his book and then from his memory</SPAN>." </FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>- The <SPAN class=em3>Muwatta </SPAN>of M√¢lik is a well known book.

<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Therefore, the use of an isn√¢d does not necessarily imply that no books were present for the purpose of transmission or that they were not available for consultation.

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>This written Qur'an, called a mushaf, was handed from the then Caliph Abu Bakr to Umar ibn al Khatt√¢b who handed it on to his daughter Hafsa.

The Prophet Muhammad had allowed the people to recite the Qur'an in seven different dialects (as it had been revealed in that way), but this had become a cause for dissension so Hudaifa went and pleaded with Uthm√¢n to unite the Muslims under one reading. Uthm√¢n decided on the Quraish dialect, which the Prophet himself had used. Zaid ibn Thabit was called in again and he repeated the task, assembling the Qur'an in the Quraishi dialect, again with the confirmation of two authorities who had it in writing, with the exception of one verse which he found with only one in a written form (but many in oral) </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Copies of this Qur'an were then sent to various parts of the empire to be used as the standard, and all other writings were ordered to be burnt.

But we could find out these variations by putting them all together and comparing the many copies one against the other, as the same errors would not be written at the same place by everyone. The final result would be a rendering which is pretty close to what I had said originally. But if we destroyed all of the copies except one, there would be no means of comparing, and all precision would be lost. Our only hope would be that the one which remained was as close to what I had said as possible. Yet we would have no other rendering or example to really know for sure. Consequently, the greater number of copies preserved, the more certitude we would have of the original."</SPAN> </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Now imagine that everyone who read this text memorized faithfully parts of it, and some faithfully memorized the whole of it, and some faithfully wrote it down on pieces of paper. Now also imagine that you are all devoted followers of J. Smith, and you believe every word he speaks. Furthermore, you believe that if you faithfully remember his words without mistake he will give you good marks. Now Joseph dies and his most promising student decides that we must publish the paper of Joseph as the definitive refutation of Islam. So he asks one of Joseph's other devoted students, who although young, had memorized the whole paper, but just to be sure he tells him to check with all those who had written copies of the whole paper in case he might have left something out. He does this and finds that there were a couple of lines he had written that were with no one else. So he keeps searching and eventually finds it with a couple of other students. So he includes it all in his final draft. Now after several years some American students of the students of Smith start arguing with some English students of the students about the use of "cookies" in stead of "biscuits" and "chips" instead of "fries" and they are ready to fight about it. So a top student of Smith hears about this, and although he knows that Smith allowed both usages in his students recitals and notes he decides for the sake of unity to use only the American usages as that was the language in which the paper was originally read. So he calls that same young student, who repeats the same process, and comes up with the same result. So the order is given for everyone to destroy every copy, and all the notes they have to prevent any future arguments, and the young students copy, of which every word has been agreed upon by at least two students who had complete written copies, was then published. This publication was agreed upon by every living student who had memorized the whole paper to be verbatim the same paper as taught by Smith and as memorized by them. Would you doubt that this was exactly what Smith's paper said? Now further imagine that thousands of people all around the world had memorized this paper, and the original young student's copy was destroyed, yet when you gathered together these memorizers and copies of the compilation from all over the world and found that they all agreed, would you doubt that this was exactly Smith's original paper? </FONT></P>

Most of them would know the words to most of the songs, and even if someone made a mistake they would immediately recognize it.

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>It must be remembered that the Qur'an is read and re-read by Muslims every day of their lives in their prayer, in the morning and sunset and night prayer it is read out loud. It is a habit of many Muslims to read the entire Qur'an in three days, some in a week and many in a month. A greater number still read the whole Qur'an at least once a year. Its ease of memorization is renowned (as the Qur'an itself states) as we can find children as young as six that have memorized the whole of it. It is of course considered the very Words of God and so is given the utmost respect and attention, and cannot be compared to mere stories and such like. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>One of the most enduring arguments for the Qur'an's authenticity is the total agreement throughout the vast Muslim empire upon one text, which proves that it must have been agreed upon from the very earliest times. This is given more weight by the fact that from the different sects, such as the Shia who trace their pretensions to Ali ibn T√¢lib, the cousin of the Prophet, the Kh√¢warij, the Qadar√Æya and the Jahmiya and other sects that arose in the earliest period of Islam, none of them were able to make a basis for their claims except through the same Qur'an that we have in our possession today. The fact that these sects could never invent or add a single verse to the Qur'an proves the Muslims were unanimously united upon a single text from the earliest times. </FONT></P>

Narrations were rejected from known liars and heretics to ensure purity of transmission. Narrators were individually evaluated for academic accuracy and memory retention. </FONT></P>

Because the cultural background of the Arabs had been oral the evidence that came to be expected was the chain of names of those who had passed on the anecdote containing the saying . . . It was soon realized that false Traditions were in circulation with sayings that Muhammad could not possibly have uttered. The chains of transmitters were therefore carefully scrutinized to make sure that the persons named could in fact have met one another, that they could be trusted to repeat the story accurately, and that they did not hold any heretical views. This implied extensive biographical studies; and many biographical dictionaries have been preserved giving the basic information about a man's teachers and pupils, the views of later scholars (on his reliability as a transmitter) and the date of his death. This biography-based critique of Traditions helped considerably to form a more or less common mind among many men throughout the caliphate about what was to be accepted and what rejected." [W.

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>- Smith also ignores the <SPAN class=em3>mut√¢wattir </SPAN>narration here (though he does mention it briefly elsewhere). By <SPAN class=em3>mut√¢wattir</SPAN>is meant that narration which is reported by such a large number of individuals in each generation and at every stage of transmission that it is impossible that they could have all gathered together upon reporting a lie/mistake. Perhaps Smith should look to familiarize himself with the books of <SPAN class=em3>mut√¢wattir </SPAN>had√Æth. Indeed, the common feature of a good many traditions is the great number of transmitters who belong to different provinces and countries. It was hardly possible for all these individuals to consult each other so as to give a uniform sense in transmitting a particular tradition.

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>For whether sacred or secular, the works that have given rise to a textual tradition seem invariably to have existed in some sort of oral form prior to being set down.

Such a process has long been accepted by scholars who spoke of a period of 'oral transmission' or 'oral tradition', scholars could call in to their help the 'fantastic memories' so 'well attested' of illiterate people.

To a degree unknown in any other culture of history, knowledge for us is 'book-learning'; and no orally communicated word carries the kind of authority for us that a written or printed document does. Ours is not only a literate, but a book and print culture; the written word has become the basic form of language. There is no doubt that today, religious scriptures of the past, are viewed in exactly the same light and with the same expectations.

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>It is for these reasons that the Companions of the Prophet were meticulous about his teachings. All his actions served them as an ideal, and hence a precedent (Sunnah); every word which he uttered was a law to them, while his moral choices, so different from those of their age, yet so immediate in their impartial wisdom, provided them with a system of personal and social virtue which they tried to follow faithfully. Given this intense devotion to the Prophet - peace and blessings upon him, inspired by his charisma and integrity, the Companions made a point of observing his life and recording for posterity everything that they could. Thus we find that Abu Hurairah kept his constant company, sacrificing all worldly pursuits, in order to see and hear what the Prophet - peace and blessings upon him - said and did, and regularly devoted a period of time to fixing in his memory the words he had heard; so much so that the Prophet - peace and blessings upon him - said to him on one occasion: "<SPAN class=hadithquote>O Abu Hurairah! I have thought that none will ask me about this had√Æth before you, as I know you're longing for had√Æth</SPAN>." [Bukh√¢r√Æ 8/574] Even those Companions who may have lived at a distance and were unable to attend the Prophet every day, made an agreement with other Companions that they would be present with him on alternate days, and report to each other everything they saw or heard from him. It is said to have been a common practice among the Companions that whenever any two of them met, one would inquire from the other whether there was any had√Æth, and the other would tell him what he knew. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The Prophet - peace and blessings upon him - himself attached the utmost importance to the knowledge of his own had√Æth and would encourage his followers to be attentive when he was imparting the message with which he was sent. Often he would be seen to repeat his words to ensure that they had been properly retained. We find the Companion Anas ibn M√¢lik declaring: "Whenever the Prophet - peace and blessings upon him - spoke a sentence, he used to repeat it thrice so that the people could understand it properly from him." [Bukh√¢r√Æ 1/95] He would ask his Companions to make his had√Æth as widely known as possible by instructing: "<SPAN class=hadithquote>It is incumbent upon those who are present to inform those who are absent . . . </SPAN>"[Bukh√¢r√Æ 1/67] and would also say: "<SPAN class=hadithquote>May All√¢h make joyful a person who heard my saying and preserved it, them transmitted it from me.</SPAN>"[Ibn M√¢jah 1/236] </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The Companions did not simply commit as many of the had√Æth as they could to memory. Some of them collected them in books known as Sahifas, which they used as a basis for lectures, and which were later preserved by their families, and by the next generation of Muslims, the Successors. This writing of knowledge was directly from the command of the Prophet - peace and blessings upon him - himself. When on one occasion he had delivered an address to the people he was asked: "<SPAN class=generalquote>O Messenger of All√¢h , have that written for me.</SPAN>" So he ordered his Companions to write it out for him [Bukh√¢r√Æ 1/112]. A bu Hurairah himself describes that a book was kept by Abdullah ibn Amr al-Aas [Bukh√¢r√Æ 1/113], and concerning this we find Nabia Abbott declaring: "<SPAN class=generalquote>The sources are unanimously emphatic that Abdullah ibn Amr al-Aas from the start recorded had√Æth and sunnah</SPAN>." [Abbott, Studies, Vol. II, p.37] M. M. Azami in his Studies in Early Had√Æth Literature (pp.34-60) gives details of 50 Companions who at one time or another preserved the had√Æth in writing. The letters which the Prophet - peace and blessings upon him - himself had sent to various provinces are no different from his had√Æth. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>As mentioned, the writings compiled by the Companions were often preserved and passed on by their families before being incorporated into later works. This led to numerous family chains of transmission about which Abbott writes: </FONT></P>

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>In this way, the had√Æth literature originated in the early life of the Prophet - peace and blessings upon him, developed largely through his lifetime and immediately after, and spread simultaneously with the spread of Islam throughout the new Muslim dominions.

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The death of the Prophet - peace and blessings upon him - signaled the end of direct Revelation.

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The Companions settled themselves in the various towns and provinces of the Islamic empire. In these towns they were surrounded by a large number of Muslims who had not met the Prophet - peace and blessings upon him - and who were eager to hear reports of his words and deeds from those who had associated with him and had heard his counsels. These Successors not only learnt from them the had√Æths but also acquired the ethos and questing for the Traditions, and their careful cultivation and preservation. Upon them devolved the preservation and propagation of the narrations for over a century, firstly in association with the Companions, and, when the latter had passed away, with the help of their own pupils. These descending generations shared in common an astonishing zeal for the pursuit of had√Æth. Rich men and women among them sacrificed their wealth for its sake, while the poor devoted their lives to it in spite of their poverty. James Robson writes </FONT></P>

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Coupled with the appearance of these literary works an elaborate method of teaching was employed. A teacher would often read from his book to his students, this being the most preferred method of transmission at this stage. Even if regular meetings were held for the teaching, only a few narrations were taught in one lesson, perhaps three or four. On other occasions the book would be read by the student back to the teacher or by a reciter and other students compared the narrations with their individual books or only listened attentively. On other occasions, the teacher would write the had√Æth himself for the student. Many other such methods were employed. A regular record of attendance was kept and after the reading of a book was completed, a note was written by the teacher giving details of attendance, e.g. who listened to the complete reading of a book and who joined partially, what part they read and what part was missed by them, giving dates and places. In this way permission was only granted to pass on those had√Æth for which a student had been in attendance. It helped to ensure that individual narrators had taken their knowledge in the correct manner and were capable of passing on what they had acquired. A student would often stay with a teacher for many years. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Comparing the narrations of various students was one of many excellent ways of ensuring the continuous accuracy of the had√Æth. A prime example is that of Yahya ibn Ma'√Æn (d.233 H) who traveled to see eighteen of the pupils of Hammaad ibn Salamah in order to compare their had√Æth and ascertain if any of them had been mistaken in their reporting [Ibn Hibb√¢n, al-Majruh√Æn]. The employment of such a method guaranteed that fabricated narrations would not go unnoticed if transmitted in this way. If a student was seen to narrate a had√Æth which was previously unknown or rare (perhaps because he had fabricated it) then it would be a simple task to compare his report with other students who sat with him in the company of their teacher, and it would be found that none of them had heard this narration from their teacher except him though they had all been in attendance at his sittings! He would then be suspected of forging that narration. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>With such activities thriving and with more and more people being continually exposed to the had√Æth, the value and importance of the Prophet's words, however, were never forgotten and always kept to the forefront. The status of the Messenger of All√¢h - peace and blessings upon him - and the awe in which he was held by the people ensured that his words were given the utmost respect that they deserved and that they were not altered or amended in any way. Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) in his <SPAN class=em3>Q√¢idah Jaleelah Tawwassul wal-Waseelah </SPAN>(p.92), whilst describing the early generations and their respect for the status of the Prophet - peace and blessings upon him - writes: </FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>"It is mentioned that M√¢lik (d.179H) was asked about Ayy√ªb as-Sakhtiyan√Æ, so he said: 'He is the most excellent from those whom I narrate had√Æth to you from. He performed Hajj twice and I did not hear (narrate) from him until I observed that as the Prophet was mentioned he wept until I felt mercy for him. When I saw what I saw about his veneration for the Prophet I wrote had√Æth from him.' M√¢lik ibn Anas would also relate: 'I have seen Muhammad ibn al-Munkadar - and he was a leading reciter - that whenever he was asked to narrate had√Æth, he wept until we had mercy on him. I have seen J√¢far ibn Muhammad - he was very facetious and given to laughter - that whenever the Prophet was mentioned to him, he would turn pale, and I have never seen him narrating except in a state of purification. Whenever Abdur-Rahm√¢n ibn al-Q√¢sim mentioned the Prophet, he turned pale as if the blood in his face dried up and his tongue turned dumb with awe of the Messenger of All√¢h - peace and blessings upon him. I have seen az-Zuhr√Æ - he was jolly and very sociable - that when the Prophet was mentioned to him, he would become so perturbed that he would not recognise you nor would you recognise him. I visited Safw√¢n ibn Sal√Æm - and he was one of the true worshippers and jurists - that whenever he mentioned the Prophet he cried and did not cease crying until the people would get up and leave him.'" </FONT></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>It is therefore not surprising to learn that the scholars were extremely exacting in their verification of the narrations and would question deeply the ones who reported had√Æth to them. Such sincere enthusiasts were not content with the mere scrutiny of the reporters. They also attempted to publicize for the whole Islamic community the character of those responsible for forgery, or for incompetent and erroneous reporting. Likewise, they would highlight those individuals who were known for their accuracy and care for the Prophetic had√Æth, mentioning their teachers, students, and often times extremely detailed descriptions of their lives. These came to be known as the 'books of rij√¢l', giving authenticating or disparaging remarks against 1000's of reporters. In the earliest period, the critics of the narrators were comparatively small because of the small number of weak reporters, and the reduced chances of mistakes and forgeries. When, towards the middle of the second century, less reliable narrators increased in number, a group of important traditionalists discussed the subject, and debated the integrity and reliability of various reporters. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>There existed then, as there continues to do so in every generation to this present day, a core of committed and competent scholars, men and women, who take it upon themselves to dedicate their lives towards carefully ascertaining what was authentic, preserving its purity and genuiness, and propagating it among the community at large. They would not accept narrations related by persons who held heretical views, nor persons who were known to commonly tell lies (even if they were not accused of it in connection with had√Æth), or people with weak memories, or who were unfamiliar with the subject matter of the material they were reporting, however pious and eminent they might appear. This careful scrutiny of those who related traditions continued with unabated vigor at each stage of transmission. Montgomery Watt writes: </FONT></P>

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman"><SPAN class=em2>2. </SPAN>Smith himself has already indicated that the likes of Bukh√¢r√Æ took a vast quantity of had√Æth, accepting some of them and rejecting others. We know from their respective works that both Bukh√¢r√Æ and Muslim set themselves the task of only collecting some of those had√Æth which were of the sah√Æh class. How could they have gone about this duty if, as Smith claims, the science of evaluation "only began in the tenth century"? Whats more, the books from the tenth century onwards are full of praise for Bukh√¢r√Æ and Muslim for fulfilling their task accurately, showing that the science of had√Æth analysis was already in place in their time. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman"><SPAN class=em2>3. </SPAN>The Sunan works of at-Tirmidh√Æ and Abu Dawud contain the authors comments after many of the had√Æth showing the reliability or weakness of the isnad.

<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Despite all of this, what difficulty does it pose - if it were true - that the science of isn√¢d analysis was not developed until the tenth century? We are only today perfecting techniques for the authentication and verification of age old artefacts.

Bernard Lewis writes: <SPAN class=generalquote>"But their careful scrutiny of the chains of transmission and their meticulous collection and preservation of variants in the transmitted narratives give to medieval Arabic historiography a professionalism and sophistication without precedent in antiquity and without parallel in the contemporary medieval West.

Their prejudicial stance in their mutual refusal to accept the Prophethood of Muhammad forces them to try and find any alternative explanation. Their inability to fight Islam according to the sources of Islam, and the fact that their attempts to discredit the Prophethood of Mohammad have proved mutually contradictory has now forced them to adopt their radical "demythologising" alternative. </FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The fact that we have amply illustrated with evidence, including that which must be acceptable to any unbiased "secular" historian, that the Qur'√¢n and authenticated traditions of the Prophet are not only reliable historical information but rank in authenticity far above anything Christianity can offer, or anything ancient and indeed much of modern history. All this leads inevitably to the conclusion that Muhammad was indeed the Universal Prophet of Allah and the early Muslim community was guided by the Light and Wisdom that ensued from Divine guidance. It is this that accounts for the phenomena of Islam, even if the disbelievers detest it.</FONT></P>
