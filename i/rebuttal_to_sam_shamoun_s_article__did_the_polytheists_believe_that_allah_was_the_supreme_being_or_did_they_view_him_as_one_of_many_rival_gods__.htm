<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman"></FONT>&nbsp;</P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><STRONG><U>
<P align=left><FONT size=5>Sam Shamoun said:</FONT></P></U></STRONG></FONT>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The Quran claims that the pagans of Muhammad's time believed that Allah was the creator and owner of the heavens and earth:</FONT></P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Say: Unto Whom (belongeth) the earth and whosoever is therein, if ye have knowledge? They will say: Unto Allah. Say: Will ye not then remember? Say: Who is Lord of the seven heavens, and Lord of the Tremendous Throne? They will say: Unto Allah (all that belongeth). Say: Will ye not then keep duty (unto Him)? Say: In Whose hand is the dominion over all things and He protecteth, while against Him there is no protection, if ye have knowledge? They will say: Unto Allah (all that belongeth). Say: How then are ye bewitched? S. 23:84-89</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>And if thou wert to ask them: Who created the heavens and the earth, and constrained the sun and the moon (to their appointed work)? they would say: Allah. How then are they turned away? Allah maketh the provision wide for whom He will of His bondmen, and straiteneth it for whom (He will). Lo! Allah is Aware of all things. And if thou wert to ask them: Who causeth water to come down from the sky, and therewith reviveth the earth after its death? they verily would say: Allah. Say: Praise be to Allah! But most of them have no sense. S. 29:61-63</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>If thou shouldst ask them: Who created the heavens and the earth? they would answer: Allah. Say: Praise be to Allah! But most of them know not. S. 31:25</FONT></P></DIR></DIR>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The Quran says that the problem of the pagans was to associate other deities with Allah:</FONT></P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>They assign unto Allah, of the crops and cattle which He created, a portion, and they say: "This is Allah's" - in their make-believe - "and this is for (His) partners in regard to us." Thus that which (they assign) unto His partners in them reacheth not Allah and that which (they assign) unto Allah goeth to their (so-called) partners. Evil is their ordinance. S. 6:136</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Allah hath not chosen any son, nor is there any god along with Him; else would each god have assuredly championed that which he created, and some of them would assuredly have overcome others. Glorified be Allah above all that they allege. S. 23:91</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>And verily, if thou shouldst ask them: Who created the heavens and the earth? they will say: Allah. Say: Bethink you then of those ye worship beside Allah, if Allah willed some hurt for me, could they remove from me His hurt; or if He willed some mercy for me, could they restrain His mercy? Say: Allah is my all. In Him do (all) the trusting put their trust. S. 39:38</FONT></P></DIR></DIR>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The Quran further states that their reason for worshiping these other gods was so that they might get closer to Allah:</FONT></P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Surely pure religion is for Allah only. And those who choose protecting friends beside Him (say): We worship them only that they may bring us near unto Allah. Lo! Allah will judge between them concerning that wherein they differ. Lo! Allah guideth not him who is a liar, an ingrate. S. 39:3</FONT></P></DIR></DIR>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>However, there are other references which indicate that the unbelievers did <EM>not</EM> view Allah as the supreme god, but believed he was just one of many rival deities. For instance, the Quran claims that Muhammad's antagonists did not worship his god Allah:</FONT></P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Say: 'O unbelievers, I serve not what you serve <STRONG><EM>and you are not serving what I serve</EM></STRONG></FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>, nor am I serving what you have served, <STRONG><EM>neither are you serving</EM></STRONG></FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3> what I serve. To you your religion, and to me my religion!' S. 109:1-6 Arberry</FONT></P></DIR></DIR>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Muhammad is even warned from insulting their gods lest they insult his deity:</FONT></P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Revile not those unto whom they pray beside Allah lest they wrongfully revile Allah through ignorance. Thus unto every nation have We made their deed seem fair. Then unto their Lord is their return, and He will tell them what they used to do. S. 6:108</FONT></P></DIR></DIR>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The above texts make no sense if the Quran is correct that the pagans worshiped Allah as the supreme deity. After all, why would they insult the high god of their pantheon and how could they be accused of not serving Allah if in fact they believed he was the creator of all and that they only worshiped other gods in order to get closer to him?</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>These verses only make sense if the pagans did not worship Allah or did not view him as the Supreme Being, but believed he was only one among many rival deities.</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The following narrative provides additional substantiation that the pagans viewed Allah as one among many gods, that is assuming that they did believe in Allah:</FONT></P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>. Abu Sufyan said, "Our victory today is a counterbalance to yours in the battle of Badr, and in war (the victory) is always undecided and is shared in turns by the belligerents, and you will find some of your (killed) men mutilated, but I did not urge my men to do so, yet I do not feel sorry for their deed" After that he started reciting cheerfully, "<STRONG><U>O Hubal, be high!</U></STRONG></FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>" On that the Prophet said (to his companions), "Why don't you answer him back?" They said, "O Allah's Apostle! What shall we say?" He said, "Say, Allah is Higher and more Sublime." (Then) Abu Sufyan said, "<STRONG><U>We have the (idol) Al Uzza, and you have no Uzza</U></STRONG></FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>." The Prophet said (to his companions), "Why don't you answer him back?" They asked, "O Allah's Apostle! What shall we say?" He said, "Say Allah is our Helper and you have no helper." (<EM>Sahih al-Bukhari</EM>, Volume 4, Book 52, <A href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/052.sbt.html#004.052.276">Number 276</A></FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>)</FONT></P></DIR></DIR>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The above tradition poses problems for the Muslim view that the pagans believed Allah was superior to the rest of the gods. Abu Sufyan's comments presuppose that Allah was either one among many deities or that he was a foreign god who could be defeated by their gods. After all, Abu Sufyan attributed the victory over Muhammad to his god Hubal and the goddess Uzza, suggesting that at least in his mind these gods were equal, if not superior, to Allah. Abu Sufyan apparently felt that Allah could be challenged and defeated.</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Now wouldn't this support the fact that the pagans didn't see Allah as the unrivaled and supreme deity?</FONT></P>

<P align=left><FONT size=5>My Response:</FONT></P></U></STRONG></FONT>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>It seems like we need to give Shamoun a class in basic Islamic theology. (Pretty pathetic to give to a man whom supposedly studied Islam for more than a decade). </FONT></P>

<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The polytheists of Mecca affirmed this belief as seen in Surah 23:84-89, 29:61-63 and 31:25.</FONT></P>

<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The polytheists of Mecca believed that Allah was the Creator of the heavens and the earth, however they still directed their worship to others besides Allah and were thus labeled as polytheists. </FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><EM><SPAN style="COLOR: black">Abu Sufyan attributes his victory over the Muslims to his gods/goddesses, e.g. Hubal and al-Uzza. He even responds to Muhammad's chant of Allah being higher by extolling the praise of his idols that assisted him in the victory against the Muslims. This shows that rather than thinking that Hubal and al-Uzza were not as great as Allah, or that they were less powerful than he, Abu Sufyan actually believed that these gods/goddesses were equal to, if not greater than, him since they could defeat his followers in battle.</SPAN></EM></FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><EM><SPAN style="COLOR: black">To put this another way so that Zawadi doesn't miss the point, the fact that Abu Sufyan attributed his victory over Muhammad and his deity to Hubal and Uzza suggests that in his mind these idols were equal, if not superior, to Muhammad's Allah. He obviously felt that Allah could be challenged and defeated, which means that the pagan Meccans didn't see Allah as the unrivaled supreme Deity as certain Quranic citations and Islamic traditions claim.</SPAN></EM></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Shamoun the neophyte who deceives himself into thinking he is knowledgeable and smart thinks that when the Meccans say "Allah" they mean the same thing that Muslims mean when they say "Allah". That is as silly as saying that Muslims and Arab Christians mean the same thing when they say "Allah". </FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Sometimes a comparison could be made. For instance, sometimes you will find Muslims trying to relate Allah to whom Christians would refer to as God the Father. However, both Muslims and Christians would agree that they still mean different things. But some Muslims try to make that relation because in Islam Allah who is above the heavens sent Jesus and in Christianity God the Father similarly sent Jesus. </FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Similarly, the Meccans believed in a supreme God whom they called Allah whom they believed is up above the heavens and isn't present on earth like the idols that they fashioned and created. Yet, everyone with half a brain (i.e. excluding Shamoun) knows that Muslims and paganistic Meccans aren't referring to the <STRONG>same Allah. </STRONG></FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>It's a tragedy when an incompetent fool like Shamoun actually thinks that he is smart or even knowledgeable.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Shamoun the imbecile fails to understand what I clearly and obviously mean by "same Allah".</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>Who is Allah <B>according to Islam? </B></FONT></FONT><B></P></B>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3><B>Islamic Allah</B> = Allah who forbids polytheism and sent the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) with the Qur'an as His final revelation.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>Who is Allah <B>according to the Qurayshi polytheists? </B></FONT></FONT><B></P></B>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3><B>Qurayshi Allah</B> = Allah who allows the worship of idols in order to get closer to him. Also, this Allah did not send Muhammad as a messenger and did not send the Qur'an as a revelation.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Now, is Shamoun the anti-intellectual buffoon trying to tell me that Salafis believe and teach that the "Islamic Allah" and "Qurayshi Allah" are the same? Or is Shamoun the neophyte who suffers from a serious problem of reading comprehension just realizing that he completely failed to understand what I obviously meant by "same Allah"? We hope it's the latter.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>So what do Salafis like Yasir Qadhi mean when they say that the Quraysh recognized Allah as their sole creator? Yasir is doing what I previously mentioned in my article and that is that we sometimes make a relation due to similarities. Since the Quraysh believed in a God out there above the heavens, we make that relation to Allah.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>So going back to the original argument that Shamoun made by appealing to this narration:</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3><SPAN class=apple-style-span><I><SPAN style="COLOR: black">. Abu Sufyan said, "Our victory today is a counterbalance to yours in the battle of Badr, and in war (the victory) is always undecided and is shared in turns by the belligerents, and you will find some of your (killed) men mutilated, but I did not urge my men to do so, yet I do not feel sorry for their deed" After that he started reciting cheerfully, "</SPAN></I></SPAN><STRONG><I><U><SPAN style="COLOR: black">O Hubal, be high!</SPAN></U></I></STRONG><SPAN class=apple-style-span><I><SPAN style="COLOR: black">" On that the Prophet said (to his companions), "Why don't you answer him back?"

(Then) Abu Sufyan said, "</SPAN></I></SPAN><STRONG><I><U><SPAN style="COLOR: black">We have the (idol) Al Uzza, and you have no Uzza</SPAN></U></I></STRONG><SPAN class=apple-style-span><I><SPAN style="COLOR: black">." The Prophet said (to his companions), "Why don't you answer him back?" They asked, "O Allah's Apostle! What shall we say?" He said, "Say Allah is our Helper and you have no helper." (</SPAN></I></SPAN><EM><SPAN style="COLOR: black; FONT-STYLE: normal">Sahih al-Bukhari</SPAN></EM><SPAN class=apple-style-span><I><SPAN style="COLOR: black">, Volume 4, Book 52,</SPAN></I></SPAN><SPAN class=apple-converted-space><I><SPAN style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</SPAN></I></SPAN><SPAN class=apple-style-span><I><SPAN style="COLOR: black"><A href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/052.sbt.html#004.052.276">Number 276</A>)</SPAN></I></SPAN><I></I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>My response, which Shamoun couldn't comprehend, is that the polytheists here clearly rejected the "Islamic Allah".</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Furthermore, saying "O Hubal, be high" doesn't mean that Hubal is the <B>highest. </B>Also, their saying that they have Al Uzza while the Muslims don't only reinforces the fact that they believed that their idols were useful in getting them closer to God.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Shamoun the ignoramus then said:</FONT></P>
<P class=bodytext style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><I><SPAN style="COLOR: black"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Finally, Zawadi's false analogy of Muslims relating Allah to God the Father in Christian theology will come to backfire against him. Muhammad expressly taught that Jews and Christians worshiped the same God as he did:</FONT></SPAN></I></P>
<P class=bodytext style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><I><SPAN style="COLOR: black"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Say (O Muhammad): "O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): Come to a word that is just between us and you,<SPAN class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><B>that we worship none but Allah</B>, and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allah. Then, if they turn away, say: "Bear witness that we are Muslims." S. 3:64 Hilali-Khan</FONT></SPAN></I></P>
<P class=bodytext style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3><I><SPAN style="COLOR: black">And argue not with the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), unless it be in (a way) that is better (with good words and in good manner, inviting them to Islamic Monotheism with His Verses), except with such of them as do wrong, and say (to them): "We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you;<SPAN class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><B>our<SPAN class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>Ilah<SPAN class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>(God) and your<SPAN class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>Ilah<SPAN class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>(God) is One (i.e. Allah)</B>, and to Him we have submitted (as Muslims)." S. 29:46 Hilali-Khan</SPAN></I><SPAN style="COLOR: black"></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>3:64 only says that the Prophet should call out to Jews and Christians to worship the same God and not that we are in fact worshipping the same God. 29:46 is not saying that we worship and believe in the same God, rather the verse is saying that our God and the God of Christians and Jews is one. So whether one wants to acknowledge whether Allah is his God or not doesn't change the fact that Allah is everyone's God in the eyes of Islam.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>So much for Shamoun's pathetic and shallow "response". Shamoun needs to stay out of territories he has no place in. He needs to stop being so dense to actually think that he could somehow outsmart&nbsp;well informed Muslims&nbsp;by talking "Salafi this" and "Salafi that". These matters are way out of Shamoun's league and he has absolutely no idea what he's talking about.<BR><BR></FONT></P>
