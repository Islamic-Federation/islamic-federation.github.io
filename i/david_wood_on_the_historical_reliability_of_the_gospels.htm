It is, however, unlikely that all Christians everywhere in this period were aware, let alone familiar, with the canonical gospels. A more realistic scenario would be as follows: initially some would have known one or some gospels (this would include non-canonical material as well) and as time went by people in different places became aware about the presence of more gospels, some of which they began to cherish and frequently use. Thus, one may have known, say, the gospel of Mark, but known nothing about the rest. Others may have known one or more of the canonical gospels as well as non-canonical gospel narratives but not the rest. As tine went by, however, people in different places increasingly became aware about the presence of additional gospel narratives.</span></font></font></span></p>

A little earlier, Matthew and Luke, on the other hand, are believed to have used and adapted the gospel of Mark in various ways to compose their own gospel narratives. If Marcan priority is accepted, then that would suggest that while Mark was deemed important enough to be heavily utilised, Matthew and Luke did not regard it to be so authoritative or reliable so as to be borrowed without changes. On the contrary, they made all sorts of changes to Mark. Luke, from his opening words, reveals his dissatisfaction with earlier gospel narratives. We read:</span></font></font></span></p>

They may be open to Lucan authorship of the gospel of Luke and Acts, but be sceptical regarding the traditional authorship claims for the remaining canonical gospels.

The purpose of the writings was to record the <i>message</i>. Papias preferred firsthand information. At this stage, Christians did not consider themselves limited or obliged to follow specific written texts. This is also clear from the writings of Clement, Barnabas, Ignatius, Hermas etc. Any tradition could be written down; there was no obligation to follow a particular writing in a mechanical fashion since it was merely a written echo of the preaching, inadequate by its very nature. This is simply the attitude of most Christian writers of the 2<sup>nd</sup> century. So while Papias considered the written records useful, he felt no obligation to limit himself to them but gave preference to oral traditions. No canonical gospel writing was &quot;final authority&quot; for the earliest Christians.</font></font></span></span></span></p>

That is the only kind of evidence his audience will accept--indeed, even so much as a <i>hint</i> that Paul checked the facts before believing the vision would destroy Paul&#39;s credibility entirely. For if he showed any doubt at all that the vision was true, if the vision was so insufficient that he had to seek reinforcement or additional instruction from mortal men, then this would cast doubt on the vision being an authentic communication from God. After all, his audience were the sort of people who thought God punished Zacharias (by striking him mute) for merely <i>asking</i> for evidence (</font><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?version=50&amp;search=Luke+1:18-20"><span style="COLOR: navy"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Luke 1:18-20</font></span></a><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">). That&#39;s how hostile the Christian mind was to Holding&#39;s dream of &quot;fact-checking.&quot; The Christian moral was that Zacharias, and hence all of us, should simply trust a vision--no questions asked, and no facts checked. The same twisted logic also makes sense of Paul&#39;s tactic of pointing out how he did a total 180 from enemy to friend, as proof that his vision must really have been from God. The fallacious logic here would impress many people back then. But we have no good reason to buy it today.</font></font></span></span></span><span lang="EN-AU" style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold"><span lang="EN-AU" style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

In fact, we do not know of anyone from the first century (probable exceptions, Matthew and Luke, who knew Mark) who knew about the canonical gospels let alone was intimately familiar with their contents. The best guess we can make is that some knew one or some gospel narratives initially, becoming aware of additional narratives over time. It was not that from the start all canonical gospels were instantly accepted everywhere. Instead, the early period is a fluid one. There were probably traditions around which ultimately did not survive, and more written gospel writings which have not survived. A lot was being said and written about Jesus and his activities, with differences between the accounts as these circulated and moved along to more people. All sorts of changes were made to the stories and sayings attributed to Jesus, minor, small and some were also invented. </font></font></span></span></span></p>

Is David trying to say that everyone in the first century who read the Gospel of Matthew which spoke about the resurrection of dead saints during Jesus&#39; crucifixion actually believed in that story and trusted the reliability of the Gospel, yet still rejected it and refused to become a Christian? </font></span></span></p>
