<br />
2. We now come to the heart of the issue being discussed, which is the reason Iblis is misunderstood to be an Angel when, in reality, he is a Jinn. The source of the confusion is the fact that verse 2:34 states that all the angels bowed down <em>except Iblis</em> which seems to imply that Iblis was an angel. However, this is not the case as the Qur'anic commentators and Islamic scholars have explained. Hasan Al-Banna (d. 1949CE) clarifies some points on this issue:</span> </font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="COLOR: maroon">The context reveals that Iblis was not one of the angels though he was with them. If he had been one of them, he would not have rebelled. Their primary quality is that &quot;they do not rebel against Allah in what He commands them and they do as they are commanded.&quot; <strong>The word &quot;except&quot; here does not show that he was one of them. The fact that he was with them allows this exception to be used. Iblis was one of the Jinn according to the text of the Qur'an. Allah created the jinn from smokeless fire. This is a clear statement that he was not one of the angels.</strong></span><span style="COLOR: black">(Quoted by M. Ashour in <em>The Jinn in the Qur'an and the Sunnah</em>, Dar Al Taqwa Ltd. 1989, pp. 11-12)</span></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="COLOR: black">Similarly, Syed Qutb (d.1966CE) comments in his prominent commentary, <em>Fi Dhilalil Qur'an</em>:</span> </font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="COLOR: maroon"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The general drift of the narration suggests that <em>Iblis</em> was not of angelic species but merely associated with the angels. For, had he been of similar kind, he would not have disobeyed God, since the angels' foremost characteristic is that they &quot;<em><b>never disobey whatever God commands them and do as they are bidden</b></em>&quot; (al-Tahrim 66:6). The fact that <em>Iblis</em> had been singled out does not mean that he is, or was, one of their number. <strong>The exception is justified on the basis that he was with the angels, as well as by Arabic syntax, which allows the construction &quot;the whole clan arrived but not Ahmad&quot; without implying that Ahmad is a member of the clan.</strong></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="COLOR: maroon"><br />
<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Furthermore, the Qur'an specifically identifies <em>Iblis</em> as belonging to another type of extra-terrestrial creatures, the <em>jinn</em>, who are created out of fire, eliminating the idea that he was angelic (al-Hijr 15:27, al-Kahf 18:50, al-Rahman 55:15).</font></span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <span style="COLOR: black">(Qutb, <em>In The Shade Of The Qur'an</em>, The Islamic Foundation 1999, p.49)</span></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="COLOR: black">Thus, the scholars mention that although the verse states that the angels bowed down 'except' (Ar., <em>Ilaa</em>) Iblis, this does not necessitate that Iblis was amongst the angels according to the arabic language. The specific arabic syntax referred to by Syed Qutb is explained by Dr. Zakir Naik, a famous orator on Islam, who states:</span> </font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="COLOR: maroon">The English translation of the first part of the verse 'We said to the angels bow down to Adam: they bowed down except Iblis', gives us the impression that Iblis was an angel. The Qur'an was revealed in Arabic. <strong>In Arabic grammar there is a rule known as Tagleeb, according to which, if the majority is addressed, even the minority is included. If for example, I address a class containing 100 students of whom 99 are boys and one is a girl, and if I say in Arabic that the boys should stand up, it includes the girl as well. I need not mention her seperately.</strong><br />
<br />
Similarly in the Qur'an, when Allah addressed the angels, even Iblis was present, but it is not required that he be mentioned separately. Therefore according to that sentence Iblis may be an angel or may not be an angel, but we come to know from Surah Al Kahf chapter 18 verse 50 that Iblis was a Jinn. No where does the Qur'an say Iblis was an angel. Therefore there is no contradiction in the Qur'an.</span> (</font></font><a target="_blank" href="http://www.drzakirnaik.com/pages/qanda/36.php"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">SOURCE</font></a><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">)</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="COLOR: black">For this reason, we can understand that any translation of verse 2:34 (and similar verses) into english should use the phrase &quot;not so Iblis&quot; or &quot;but not Iblis&quot; as oppose to &quot;except Iblis&quot;, in order to retain the correct meaning of the verse. <br />
<br />
The reason why Iblis was expected to bow down, even though the command was given to the angels, is explained by many scholars. Moiz Amjad writes about why Iblis was expected to prostrate:</span> </font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>

For instance, when someone says: &quot;When the Chief Justice enters the hall all the parliamentarians shall pay their respects by standing up for him&quot;, he generally implies that all those present in the hall (personnel of the press, the foreign diplomats, the media personnel and guests of the members) should stand to pay their respects to the Chief Justice. The word 'parliamentarians' in such a sentence is not to signify that the directive is given only to those who are members of the parliament, but is a generalization in which a higher cadre of personnel is given a directive with the implication that others are also expected to follow suit.</span> (</font></font><a target="_blank" href="http://understanding-islam.com/related/text.asp?type=article&amp;aid=127&amp;sscatid=89"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">SOURCE</font></a><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">)</font></p>

Why then did he need to obey the command which was directed to the angels [specially when men and Jinns have the right to choose]? This is because; he was raised with them and required to obey the laws applied to them while in their [Angels] company. This is similar to requiring that a foster son obey the rules of his foster father while living within his house. It is not necessary for the foster father, whenever he commands his sons to do something, to follow up with an explicit &quot;and my foster son too must do this,&quot; rather, it is implicitly understood that so long as the foster son lives in this house he shall follow the same rules and commands as apply to the other sons.<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="COLOR: black">From the above discussion we have established the following points:<br />
a) Iblis was a Jinn, distinct from angels<br />
b) Iblis was expected to bow down as well, when the command was given to the angels<br />
c) The phrase &quot;they (the angels) bowed down, except Iblis&quot; should be properly translated as &quot;they (the angels) bowed down, but not Iblis&quot; because according to the arabic syntax, the phrase does not necessitate that Iblis is an angel, and indeed we know that he is not from other verses in the Qur'an, ahadith, and authentic explanations of the early muslims.<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="COLOR: black"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">3. Muslims have also raised another important point in response to this allegation. If Iblis truly believed that that the command to bow down was solely directed towards the angels, he should have said so when God asked him &quot;why did you not bow down?&quot;. Instead, we find that he made claims that he was superior to Adam because of the nature of his creation. (Cf. Al-Hijr 15: 30 - 33, Al-A`raaf: 7: 11 - 12, Sa'd 39: 73 - 76)<br />

4. Critics intend to confuse readers by quoting narrations of the early Muslims, especially those from the collection known as Tarikh At-Tabari which states that the Jinn were from amongst the angels. There are several errors with this method. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="COLOR: black">We challenge such critics to provide evidence that scholars of hadith have accepted the narrations, which they have quoted from At-Tabari, as authentic. It should be noted that the only collections of narrations that Muslims accept as <em>fully</em> authentic are Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim. <br />
<br />
b) The same critics attempt to defend their use of narrations from At-Tabari by citing evidence which demonstrates that Imaam At-Tabari could distinguish between weak and authentic narrations. Of course, their evidence only demonstrates that Imaam At-Tabari authenticated and examined <em>some</em> specific narrations, not that he authenticated his entire collection! No Muslim scholar would accept such a claim. Moreover, there is a narration mentioned in Ibn Kathir that completely falsifies the view that Imaam At-Tabari believed the Jinn (or Iblis) to be from the Angels. Ibn Kathir cites a narration from a renowned scholar amongst the early Muslims (tabi'een), Imaam Hasan Al-Basri:</span> </font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="COLOR: maroon">Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, &quot;Iblis was not one of the angels, not even for a second. He was the origin of the Jinn just as Adam, upon him be peace, was the origin of mankind.'' <strong>This was narrated by Ibn Jarir with a Sahih chain. (ftn. At-Tabari 18:506)</strong></span> <span style="COLOR: black">(<em>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</em>, Abridged, Darussalam Publishers &amp; Distributors, 2000, vol. 6, p. 171)</span></font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Thus, not only do we have an <strong>authentic</strong> narration from one of the early Muslims stating that Iblis was a Jinn, distinguished from the angels, but we also have Imaam Ibn Jarir At-Tabari affirming this narration in his collection! Therefore, since Imaam At-Tabari narrates one authentic narration stating that Iblis was not an angel, and he also narrates some unauthentic narrations stating that Iblis was an angel, it is obvious which narration takes precedence. The narrations cited by critics have never been labeled as authentic by scholars, whereas the above narration clearly has. It is safe to conclude that this authentic narration properly describes the Islamic belief that Iblis was a Jinn, not an angel.<br />
<br />
c) One last point should be made about the usage of narrations from At-Tabari. It is obviously fallacious to use such narrations to prove a contradiction in the Qur'an since the Qur'an supercedes all narrations in any case.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="COLOR: black">Shaykh Mustafa Ashour, an Egyptian Islamic scholar, also explains the origin of the view that Iblis was an angel:</span> </font></font></p>

Ibn Kathir, however, points out that the early scholars related many traditions about this point. <strong>Most of them came from Jewish sources which were quoted so that they could be investigated</strong>.<span style="COLOR: black"> (Ashour, <em>The Jinn in the Qur'an and the Sunnah</em>, Dar Al Taqwa Ltd. 1989, p. 12)</span></font></font></p>
