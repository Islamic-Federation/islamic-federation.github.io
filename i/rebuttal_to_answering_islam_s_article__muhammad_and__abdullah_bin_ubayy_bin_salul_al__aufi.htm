<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">First of all, the Prophet never ordered the killing of Abdullah bin Ubay. When you read the word in Arabic, it is &#39;ya&#39;athirni&#39;, meaning &#39;help&#39; or &#39;relieve&#39;. Even look at how Ibn Kathir translates it.....</font></p>

<p><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">When the Muslims reacted by saying that they will kill him that was THEIR idea of helping the Prophet!
