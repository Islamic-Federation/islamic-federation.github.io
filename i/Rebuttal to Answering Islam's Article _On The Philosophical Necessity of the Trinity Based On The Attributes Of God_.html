<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><b><u><span style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt">Answering Islam said:</span></u></b> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Muslims often argue for the unity of God from the viewpoint that more than one God would bring chaos and fighting between the gods. </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">This is true if we think of many separate gods, but Christians only believe in ONE God, not many gods. But we believe that there is more "inner structure" to the Godhead that a unitary one. </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><b><u><span style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt">My Response:</span></u></b> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: black">No we don't, we argue that there is only true God just like how Jesus made it clear that the Father is the only true God...</span> </font></font></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><b><u><span style="COLOR: navy">John 17:3</span></u></b> </font></font></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, <b><u>the only true God</u></b>, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent. </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: black">Therefore, when you call Jesus God you associate partners with God. That is our problem. It is the problem of polytheism. Islam is a monotheistic faith. The trinity is not. Christians THINK that they believe in one God, but they really don't.&nbsp;</span> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">&nbsp; </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><b><u><span style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt">Answering Islam said:</span></u></b> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">The following explanation is actually a very classical one used by St. Augustine in his book "On the Trinity" [De Trinitate] in the 5th century. </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">We read in the Word of God, in 1 John 4:8 that "God is Love". </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">What are the necessary conditions that this can be a true statement? </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">For any event of "love" we do need the subject who loves, we need an object which is loved, and we need an expression of this love in some way, i.e. an interaction between the first two. </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">I cannot love when I am "just by myself". Focussing only on myself is egotism, not love. </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Now, how can God BE Love if he was solitary in "unitary aloneness" from eternity past? None of the attributes of God are dependent on his creation. If God could only start loving after he had created us then his attribute of love would be dependent on us. He would not be self-sufficient in his attributes. But if he is unitary as Muslims believe, then love necessarily cannot be an attribute of his [nor can justice or mercy or any other relational attribute] because he is not in any relationship for eternity before he creates. </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">If God is not relational, how would he come to the idea to create anything ? How would he come to the desire to have an extension of his relationality beyond the Godhead if relationality is not part of his nature/attributes? </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">No, we all believe God created and he communicates with his creation. God is a communicator. God is love. But this can only be if he is love from eternity and hence there must be some relationality and expression and exchange of love within God himself. </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">That is where the trinity [or some kind of plurality] becomes philosophically necessary for God. Yes there is one God only but this God is love and is relational. And hence there needs to be "interaction of giving and receiving within the Godhead". That is why we need something like the Trinity. </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Augustine then says that Father and Son are eternally in love with each other, giving and receiving, and that the Spirit is maybe like the personalization of this 'dynamic relationship', the transporting the love of the one to the other. </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Note again: This is a model, an analogy again. No analogy is perfect. But think about it, and let me know how you think God can have relational attributes if he was a solitary unity from eternity past. </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><b><u><span style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt">My Response:</span></u></b> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: black">Allah describes himself in the Quran as all loving...</span> </font></font></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><b><u><span style="COLOR: navy">Surah 85:14</span></u></b> </font></font></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">and He is the All-forgiving, the All-loving </font></font></p>

<p></p>

<p style="margin-top:0in"><span style="color:black;background:white">Answering Islam said:</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.0pt;margin-left:.5in"><em><span style="color:black;background:white">God is love. But this can only be if he is love from eternity and hence there must be some relationality and expression and exchange of love within God himself.</span></em><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="color:black;background:white">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: black">This logic is very weak. Because then I could argue the following:-</span> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><b><span style="COLOR: green">There was no one for the Unitarian God to love in the beginning and therefore he was not All Loving. But also, there was no one for God to forgive before he created us, so that also means that God is not All Forgiving!</span></b> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: black">Anyone can see this fallacious argument crumbling already. Are Christians trying to also say that since God is triune then that means that each member of the God head forgave the other so that God could be All Forgiving? Of course not. For someone to be forgiven he would have had to commit a sin right? Well does any member of the Godhead commit sins? Christian will respond back and say no.&nbsp;</span> </font></font></p>

<p></p>

<p style="margin-top:0in"><span style="color:black;background:white">Answering Islam said...</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.0pt;margin-left:.5in"><i><span style="color:black;background:white">For any event of "love" we do need the subject who loves, we need an object which is loved, and we need an expression of this love in some way, i.e. an interaction between the first two.</span></i></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: black">I could also argue that God was not a creator before He created anything. I could also argue that God was not many things before He created anything if I were to use this fallacious and illogical missionary way of thinking.&nbsp;</span> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">&nbsp; </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: black">SO JUST BECAUSE GOD DID NOT EXHIBIT OR IMPLEMENT HIS ATTRIBUTES BEFORE HIS CREATION THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT HE DID NOT HAVE THOSE ATTRIBUTES.

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: black">It is very obvious that you wrote it quickly because you did not even think about what you were saying. </span></font></font></p>

<p align="center" style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><b><u><span style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt">Appendix</span></u></b> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Sam Shamoun wrote two separate articles in response to mine. The first one could be found here </font><a href="http://www.answeringislam.net/Responses/Osama/zawadi_allah_needs_sinners.htm"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">http://www.answeringislam.net/Responses/Osama/zawadi_allah_needs_sinners.htm</font></a><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">&nbsp; </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Sam Shamoun quotes some hadith from Sahih Muslim and then concludes that the hadith say that Allah MUST create human sinners in order to display His attribute of forgiveness.&nbsp; </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">This is absurd; the hadith in no way says that God needed to create sinners. First of all, God has the power to forgive and it is His gift to us. He does not lose anything or gain anything from His Kingdom if people were to reject Him for He is not in need of us. The following hadith makes this clear... </font></font></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Narrated Abi Dhar:<br>
Allaah, the Exalted, says, "My servants, all of you are misguided except whoever I have guided, so ask Me for guidance and I will guide you. And all of you are poor except whoever I have made rich, so ask Me for sustenance. All of you are sinners except whoever I have pardoned, <b><u>so whoever of you knows that I possess the power of forgiveness, then asked Me for forgiveness, then I have forgiven him, and I do not mind. </u></b>And if the first of you and the last of you and your living and your dead and your strong and your weak were all to unite on the heart of the most pious slave of My slaves, <b><u>this would not have added to My kingdom the wing of a mosquito.</u></b> And if the first of you and the last of you and your living and your dead and your strong and your weak were all to unite on the heart of the most wretched slave of My slaves, this would not have subtracted from My kingdom the wing of a mosquito. And if the first of you and the last of you and your living and your dead and your strong and your weak were all to come together in one clearing, then each person of you asked for what would fulfill his desires, then I gave to each asker of you what he asked for, <b><u>this would not have diminished My kingdom except as if one of you passed by the sea then dipped a needle into it then lifted it to himself. This is because I am Generous (jawwaad), Exalted, I do whatever I wish. My gift is nothing but My command, My punishment is nothing but My command. Rather, My command to something if I willed it is to say 'Be', so it becomes."(</u>At-tirmidhi, Kitaab Sifat Al-Qiyaama wa Ar-raqaa'iq wal-war3, Number 2419: A reference is found in the following hadeeth which al-Uthaimeen says is hasan:, <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/tawheed/namesofallaah.html">Source</a>)</b> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The reason God creates human sinners is so that they can come back and repent to Allah, for Allah loves those who repent...</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> &nbsp; </font></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><b><u><span style="COLOR: navy; FONT-SIZE: 18pt">Saheeh Muslim</span></u></b> </font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Book 037, Number 6611: </font></font></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Allah is more pleased with the repentance of His servant when he turns penitently towards Him than one of you would be on finding the lost camel. </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">So Shamoun needs to stop imposing his false interpretation unto the text of the hadith.</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> &nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Qur'an makes it absolutely clear that Allah is in no need of His creation and wants... </font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><b><u><font color="#000080">Surah 14:8</font></u></b> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">And Moses said: "If ye show ingratitude, ye and all on earth together, <b><u>yet is God free of all wants,</u></b> worthy of all praise. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><b><u><font color="#000080">Surah 64:6</font></u></b> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">That was because there came to them their Messengers with clear proofs (signs), but they said: "Shall mere men guide us?" So they disbelieved and turned away (from the truth), <b><u>and Allah was not in need (of them). And Allah is Rich (Free of all wants),</u></b> Worthy of all praise. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><b><u><font color="#000080">Surah 3:97</font></u></b> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In it are clear signs, the standing place of Ibrahim, and whoever enters it shall be secure, and pilgrimage to the House is incumbent upon men for the sake of Allah, (upon) every one who is able to undertake the journey to it; and whoever disbelieves, <b><u>then surely Allah is Self-sufficient, above any need of the worlds.</u></b> </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><b><u><font color="#000080">Surah 35:15</font></u></b> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">O mankind! it is you who stand in need of Allah, <b><u>but Allah is Rich (Free of all wants and needs), </u></b>Worthy of all praise.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It even comes in a qudsi hadith... </font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Allah (SWT) said: `<b><u>I am so self-sufficient that I am in no need of having an associate. </u></b>Thus he who does an action for someone else's sake as well as Mine shall have that action renounced by Me to the one whom he associated with Me." <b>(Sahih Muslim, 18/115, Kitab al-zuhd, bab tahrim al-riya', cited <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/humanrelations/womeninislam/idealmuslimah/chapter10.html">here</a>)</b></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Allah is clearly in no need of an associate, however Shamoun believes that God does need an associate to love from eternity. This shows how weak Shamoun's concept of God is. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">As for Shamoun's second article, which could be found here </font><a href="http://www.answeringislam.net/Responses/Osama/zawadi_trinity_love.htm"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">http://www.answeringislam.net/Responses/Osama/zawadi_trinity_love.htm</font></a><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Shamoun says... </font></font></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><i>For instance, being able to create doesn't necessitate a relationship between two parties. After all, God doesn't have to create something in order to be all-powerful or self-sufficient since his ability to create doesn't depend on the existence of more than one entity. It merely depends on his having enough power to create whatever he pleases.</i> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">I never said that God was not eternally All Powerful, but that He is not eternally having the title of "The Creator" if we were to remain consistent. That means that before creation, it would be incorrect of us to say that God was "The Creator". But then in this way you're denying that God is "The Creator" from all eternity, which is false. Shamoun fails to escape my refutation. </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">He continues on to say... </font></font></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><i>Yet forgiveness is not required for God to be perfectly loving provided that those he loves are living in perfect union and fellowship with him. It is only when such persons sin that God would need to show forgiveness, provided that he does love them. Thus, Zawadi's counter-arguments fall to the ground and fail to refute anything.</i> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Just as forgiveness is not a requirement for God to exhibit and can choose to do so when He wills, similarly with love God can choose to exhibit His attribute of love whenever He wills. I challenge Shamoun to show me a single verse from the Bible that says that God was exhibiting His attribute of love even before creation. He cannot. Why is it that God can choose to exhibit his attribute of forgiveness and ability to create at a specific point in time but that He has to exhibit His attribute of love from eternity? The statement "God is love" does not prove that God was exhibiting his attribute of love before creation. It means that He is the source of love and his love is infinite in abundance. The Bible also says that God is a merciful God (Deuteronomy 4:31) but whom was He being merciful to before creation? Does that mean that he was not eternally Merciful? Of course not. He had the attribute but just never exhibited it. The same thing is with love. </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">After quoting the following forged hadith... </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3. Allah says, "I was a hidden treasure, and I wished to be known, so I created a creation (mankind), then made Myself known to them, and they recognised Me." (</font><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/scienceofhadith/afor.html#F2"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Source</font></a><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">) </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Shamoun says... </font></font></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><i>Thus, here we find additional corroboration that Allah was in dire need of creatures that could love and worship him! Allah is clearly not like the God of the Holy Bible in this regard, and in many other aspects as well.</i> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">This is absolutely absurd. Nowhere does the forged hadith even say that God NEEDED to be known but WISHED to be known. Shamoun needs to stop twisting the meaning of statements. </font></font></p>
