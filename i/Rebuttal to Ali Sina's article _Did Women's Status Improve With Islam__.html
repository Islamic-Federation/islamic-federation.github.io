</font></a><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas:<br>
I had been eager to ask 'Umar about the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said (in the Qur'an saying): If you two (wives of the Prophet namely Aisha and Hafsa) turn in repentance to Allah your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet likes) (66.4), till performed the Hajj along with 'Umar (and on our way back from Hajj) he went aside (to answer the call of nature) and I also went aside along with him carrying a tumbler of water. When he had answered the call of nature and returned. I poured water on his hands from the tumbler and he performed ablution. I said, "O Chief of the believers!

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in" align="left"><font color="#003300"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#000080">Then 'Umar went on relating the narration and said. "I and an Ansari neighbor of mine from Bani Umaiya bin Zaid who used to live in 'Awali Al-Medina, used to visit the Prophet in turns. He used to go one day, and I another day. When I went I would bring him the news of what had happened that day regarding the instructions and orders and when he went, he used to do the same for me. <span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00">We, the people of quraish, used to have authority over women, but when we came to live with the ansar, we noticed that the ansari women had the upper hand over their men, so our women started acquiring the habits of the ansari women. Once i shouted at my wife and she paid me back in my coin and i disliked that she should answer me back</span>.She said, 'Why do you take it ill that I retort upon you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet retort upon him, and some of them may not speak with him for the whole day till night.' What she said scared me and I said to her, 'Whoever amongst them does so, will be a great loser.' <i>.</i></font><i> &nbsp; </i></font></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#003300"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(This is a long Hadith; please read all of it in my article </font><a href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/mariah.htm"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Maryiah</font></a><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"> the Coptic Maid.) </font></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#003300"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">As you see here Umar is complaining that while the people of Quraish, used to have "authority" over their women, since they came to Medina they noticed that the Ansari women had the upper hand over their men. &nbsp; </font></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#003300" size="3">Mecca was a religious hub. In all religious centers, often fanaticism overrides commonsense and wherever religion has a stronger grip, women are discriminated. Mecca was no exception. It was natural that women in Mecca had a lower status than their Jews and Ansari counterparts and when they encountered the liberty that the women of Medina enjoyed, they wanted it too. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#003300" size="3">Arabs were not used to write their history. Very little is left of their pre Islamic culture and way of life. What the Muslim historian wrote of that time is all derogatory calling it the days of ignorance "jahiliya" and claiming that until the advent of Islam they were barbarians, who buried their daughters alive and were constantly in war. They say that women prior to Islam were worth less than camels and it was the Prophet who gave them the status of human being. The above hadith however tell us a different story. We can see that Arab women everywhere, except in Mecca, had more rights that Islam took them away. And it shows that the dismal treatment of women in Islam is not a Divine mandate but is how the Qurash used to treat their women. The Prophet being from Quraish himself was used to that kind of women abuse and to him that was the right way. Naturally he projected his is bias against women in his religion and his book.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b><u><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">My Response:</font></u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">All that this shows is that Mecca indeed was a city in which its inhabitants followed the universal principle of a man having authority (not superiority) over his wife, unlike the opposite case in Medina where women had authority over their husbands.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">One major objective of this paper is to provide a fair evaluation of what Islam contributed (or failed to contribute) toward the restoration of woman's dignity and rights. In order to achieve this objective, it may be useful to review briefly how women were treated in general in previous civilizations and religions, especially those which preceded Islam (Pre-610 C.E.). Part of the information provided here, however, describes the status of woman as late as the nineteenth century, more than twelve centuries after Islam.</font> </font></font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Women in Ancient Civilization</font></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">Describing the status of the Indian woman, Encyclopedia Britannica states:</font> </font></font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">In India, subjection was a cardinal principle. Day and night must women be held by their protectors in a state of dependence says Manu. The rule of inheritance was agnatic, that is descent traced through males to the exclusion of females.</font> </font></font></blockquote><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">In Hindu scriptures, the description of a good wife is as follows: "a woman whose mind, speech and body are kept in subjection, acquires high renown in this world, and, in the next, the same abode with her husband."</font> </font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">In Athens, women were not better off than either the Indian or the Roman women.</font> </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">"Athenian women were always minors, subject to some male - to their father, to their brother, or to some of their male kin.</font> </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">Her consent in marriage was not generally thought to be necessary and "she was obliged to submit to the wishes of her parents, and receive from them her husband and her lord, even though he were stranger to her."</font> </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">A Roman wife was described by an historian as: "a babe, a minor, a ward, a person incapable of doing or acting anything according to her own individual taste, a person continually under the tutelage and guardianship of her husband."</font> </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">In the Encyclopedia Britannica, we find a summary of the legal status of women in the Roman civilization:</font> </font></font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">In Roman Law a woman was even in historic times completely dependent. If married she and her property passed into the power of her husband . . . the wife was the purchased property of her husband, and like a slave acquired only for his benefit. A woman could not exercise any civil or public office . could not be a witness, surety, tutor, or curator; she could not adopt or be adopted, or make will or contract. Among the Scandinavian races women were:</font> </font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">under perpetual tutelage, whether married or unmarried. As late as the Code of Christian V, at the end of the 17th Century, it was enacted that if a woman married without the consent of her tutor he might have, if he wished, administration and usufruct of her goods during her life.</font> </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">According to the English Common Law:</font> </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#ff0000" size="3">...all real property which a wife held at the time of a marriage became a possession of her husband. He was entitled to the rent from the land and to any profit which might be made from operating the estate during the joint life of the spouses. As time passed, the English courts devised means to forbid a husband's transferring real property without the consent of his wife, but he still retained the right to manage it and to receive the money which it produced. As to a wife's personal property, the husband's power was complete. He had the right to spend it as he saw fit.</font></p>
</blockquote><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">Only by the late nineteenth Century did the situation start to improve. "By a series of acts starting with the Married women's Property Act in 1870, amended in 1882 and 1887, married women achieved the right to own property and to enter contracts on a par with spinsters, widows, and divorcees." As late as the Nineteenth Century an authority in ancient law, Sir Henry Maine, wrote: "No society which preserves any tincture of Christian institutions is likely to restore to married women the personal liberty conferred on them by the Middle Roman Law."</font> </font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">In his essay The Subjection of Women, John Stuart Mill wrote:</font> </font></font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">We are continually told that civilization and Christianity have restored to the woman her just rights. Meanwhile the wife is the actual bondservant of her husband; no less so, as far as the legal obligation goes, than slaves commonly so called.</font> </font></font></blockquote><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">Before moving on to the Qur'anic decrees concerning the status of woman, a few Biblical decrees may shed more light on the subject, thus providing a better basis for an impartial evaluation. In the Mosaic Law, the wife was betrothed. Explaining this concept, the Encyclopedia Biblica states: "To betroth a wife to oneself meant simply to acquire possession of her by payment of the purchase money; the betrothed is a girl for whom the purchase money has been paid." From the legal point of view, the consent of the girl was not necessary for the validation of her marriage. "The girl's consent is unnecessary and the need for it is nowhere suggested in the Law."</font> </font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">As to the right of divorce, we read in the Encyclopedia Biblica: "The woman being man's property, his right to divorce her follows as a matter of course." The right to divorce was held only by man. "In the Mosaic Law divorce was a privilege of the husband only .... "</font> </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">The position of the Christian Church until recent centuries seems to have been influenced by both the Mosaic Law and by the streams of thought that were dominant in its contemporary cultures. In their book, Marriage East and West, David and Vera Mace wrote:</font> </font></font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">Let no one suppose, either, that our Christian heritage is free of such slighting judgments. It would be hard to find anywhere a collection of more degrading references to the female sex than the early Church Fathers provide. Lecky, the famous historian, speaks of (these fierce incentives which form so conspicuous and so grotesque a portion of the writing of the Fathers . . . woman was represented as the door of hell, as the mother of all human ills. She should be ashamed at the very thought that she is a woman. She should live in continual penance on account of the curses she has brought upon the world. She should be ashamed of her dress, for it is the memorial of her fall. She should be especially ashamed of her beauty, for it is the most potent instrument of the devil). One of the most scathing of these attacks on woman is that of Tertullian: Do you know that you are each an Eve? The sentence of God on this sex of yours lives in this age: the guilt must of necessity live too. You are the devil's gateway: you are the unsealer of that forbidden tree; you are the first deserters of the divine law; you are she who persuades him whom the devil was not valiant enough to attack. You destroyed so easily God's image, man. On account of your desert - that is death - even the Sop of God had to die). Not only did the church affirm the inferior status of woman, it deprived her of legal rights she had previously enjoyed.</font> <font color="#000000"><b>(Jamal Badawi, <i>The Status of Women In Islam</i>, <a href="http://www.iad.org/books/S-women.html">Source</a>)</b></font> </font></font></blockquote></blockquote>

<font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">But there is also another factor that played a great role in the destiny of Muslim women; and that is the impact that the wives of the Prophet had on the Quran and its laws about women.&nbsp; </font></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#003300" size="3">Anytime that the Prophet needed to say the ultimate word and make others shut up, he would make his Allah reveal a verse. He was an old man, having a harem of almost 20 wives and concubines. All of his wives were young and beautiful (Except the first two, Kadijah and Saudah, whom he married when he was a poor man). In his old age he became the chieftain and very powerful. So he could afford to marry anyone and some even came and offered themselves to him. He would choose only the pretty ones. But political power is not a substitute to physical stamina. The Prophet was fully aware of the age gap between his young wives and himself. He was jealous of other young men looking at them and would warn his wives to not betray him.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Honestly, I don't know what to refute. Because Ali Sina has shown nothing. He comes from a back round where he thinks that it is not that big of a deal that a man can let his wife go out dressed the way she wants and have a bunch of guys staring at her and trying to hit on her and flirt with her. Of course we are jealous over our wives. Not because we are control freaks but because we love them that much. Honor needs to be protected.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Only two of the Prophet's wives were teenagers and they were Mariyah and Saffiya.&nbsp; The Prophet was not a control freak. Ali Sina is just coming up with his own crazy interpretations.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#003300"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The truth that women in Arabia had more liberty and authority before Islam than after it can also be evinced from the fact that Khadijah, the Prophet's first wife had a business of her own and had many men at her service. Muhammad, in fact was but one of her employees. Do we have any tale of women after Islam, running their own business and hiring men to work for them? &nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> &nbsp;</font></font></p>

Once Allah's Apostle went out to the Musalla (to offer the prayer) o 'Id-al-Adha or Al-Fitr prayer. Then he passed by the women and said, "O women! Give alms, as I have seen that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-fire were you (women)." They asked, "Why is it so, O Allah's Apostle ?" He replied, "You curse frequently and are ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you. A cautious sensible man could be led astray by some of you." The women asked, "O Allah's Apostle! What is deficient in our intelligence and religion?" He said, "Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?" They replied in the affirmative. He said, "This is the deficiency in her intelligence. Isn't it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses?" The women replied in the affirmative. He said, "This is the deficiency in her religion."&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#003300" size="3">So according to the holy Prophet's great reasoning, women are deficient in intelligence because the witness of two of them equal to the witness of one man. And they are also deficient in religion because during their menses they cannot pray or fast. It is not clear what the holy Prophet meant by "deficient in religion". Perhaps he meant that women are spiritually less evolved than men. By using these excuses to prove his case It seems that these unjust laws have been already prevalent among the Arabs. The Prophet, however made them universal by inserting them in the Quran. But isn't it absurd to prove an absurdity by the authority of another absurdity? Who said a woman's witness should be worth half of that of a man? Whether it was the Prophet who devised such an unfair ordinance or he echoed what was customary among his people, this law is unreasonable and cannot be used as a proof to call women deficient in intelligence.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#003300" size="3">The Prophet always used fear as a means to drive home his point. His Allah would send women to hell for the most trivial things like displeasing their husbands.</font></p>

It implies that women are incapable or should not be allowed to work and become independent and providers. It assumes that women's work at home, taking care of the children and the house is worth nothing and she must be grateful for the piece of bread that her husband graciously provide her. Up to here women are nothing but slaves. Yet the holy Prophet (peace be upon him) did not stop there. He instructs men to punish their wives, verbally, sexually and even physically, thus downgrading them to the level of animals. In a world that you could pay a fine for cruelty to animals, these "divine' teachings are very difficult to swallow. It is unthinkable that a compassionate and just God could ever say such a horrendous things about women.

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">The first reason then why men are "qawwamun" over women is because of their physical ability to protect women. The second is that "they (i.e. men) spend out of their wealth." Although the Holy Qur'an permits women to earn and own wealth, it expects that men will generally be able to earn more than women because of the natural differences between them. This means that they will generally be responsible for the economic needs of women and this responsibility also makes them "qawwamun".</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">In thinking of men as "qawwamun" over women we should not limit their role to mere protectors and providers. Properly taking care of women requires more than ensuring their physical security and providing food and shelter. It also requires looking after their psychological and emotional needs which can be summed up in terms of the need for love (30:21). Thus man's role in the relationship between men and women (as husbands and wives) generally consists of three things: protecting the woman, looking after her economic needs and giving her love." </font><b><font color="#000000">(Ahmad Shafaat, <i>A Commentary On The Quran 4:34</i>, <a href="http://www.call-to-monotheism.com/www.themodernreligion.com/women/dv-4-34-shafaat.html">Source</a>)</font></b></font></font></p>

We went out with the Prophet to a garden called Ash-Shaut till we reache d two walls between which we sat down. The Prophet said, "Sit here," and went in (the garden). The Jauniyya (a lady from Bani Jaun) had been brought and lodged in a house in a date-palm garden in the home of Umaima bint An-Nu'man bin Sharahil, and her wet nurse was with her. <span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00">When the Prophet entered upon her, he said to her, "Give me yourself (for sex) as a gift."
