<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">At this time the Prophet (peace be upon him) was not even guided with the truth. He did not know who God was and did not truly worship Him the way He should be worshipped. Secondly, the verse prohibiting the eating of food sacrificed under anything besides God's name came much later and therefore there wasn't a law that the Prophet (peace be upon him) broke in this situation. Once the Prophet (peace be upon him) was guided to the truth by having revelations sent down to him, he did nothing but promote against idol worship.</font></p>

Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, says, 'And we appointed a method of sacrifice for every nation, which they followed, so let them not dispute with you about the matter, and call to your Lord.

<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">If it was the Muslim's intention to worship the idols surrounding the Ka'bah then why did they go and destroy them once they conquered Makkah? It makes no sense.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Moiz Ahmad was asked regarding this issue and he replied back very logically...</font></p>

<p align="justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 9.5pt"><font color="#ff0000"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">All that I can say about your statements cited above is that you have very successfully criticized your own interpretation of the referred incident. However, a more honest and a more academic approach of criticizing Islam, in my opinion, would rather have been to first understand the implication of facing the <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Ka`bah</span></i> (with or without the idols) according to the Muslim mind, and then to criticize that implication. Nevertheless, rather than going through this academic exercise, you have ascribed a certain implication to the act of facing the <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Ka`bah</span></i> during the Muslim prayers and have criticized that implication, as if it were the real implication held and ascribed to by the Muslims as well as promoted by the Prophet (pbuh). Do you consider this as being intellectually honest? </font></font></font></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 9.5pt"><font color="#ff0000"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Idolatry, I am sure you know, is to worship idols. Had Mohammed (pbuh) been so fond of worshiping idols, as you have implied in your comments, he would have made the necessary adjustments and compromises in his message, while he was still in Mekkah, and thereby avoided his own and his family's persecution, when the time was right for it. After all, what benefits would now have accrued of worshiping idols, when he had already enflamed the enmity and hatred of all of the Arab nations against himself, in particular, and his followers, in general. </font></font></font></span></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 9.5pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">If your interpretation of the incident is held to be correct, then facing the <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Ka`bah</span></i>, with or without the idols, is itself idolatry. However, contrary to what you have interpreted from the incident, when Muslims offer their prayers facing the <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Ka`bah</span></i>, it is not the <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Ka`bah</span></i> that they worship, but the one God. Facing the <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Ka`bah</span></i> symbolizes a number of things, but worshiping the <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Ka`bah</span></i> is definitely not one of them, just as the Jews did not worship the Ark, when they turned toward it, during <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Amidah</span></i></font></font></span><a title="" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn2" name="_ftnref2" href="file:///D:/Bassam/Islam/My%20Articles/Islam/articles%20ready%20to%20be%20posted/articles%20that%20have%20been%20posted/Was%20Prophet%20Muhammad%20an%20idol%20worshipper%20ADJUST%20THE%20BIBLICAL%20SOLOMON%20LINK.htm#_ftn2"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic; mso-bidi-font-size: 9.5pt; mso-special-character: footnote"><sup><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">[1]</font></sup></span></i></span></a></font><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 9.5pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">. In exactly the same manner, when the Prophet (pbuh), according to the directives of the Qur'an, turned toward the <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Ka`bah</span></i> in his prayers, even while it was filled with idols, it did not signify worshiping or paying homage to the idols. It only signified worshiping the one God, facing the direction ordained by Him.</font> <b>(<a href="http://www.understanding-islam.com/related/text.asp?type=discussion&amp;did=2">Source</a>)</b></font></font></span></p>

Then he kissed it and said, 'There is no reason for us to do Ramal (in Tawaf) except that we wanted to show off before the pagans, and now Allah has destroyed them.'

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">We can see that Umar was even acknowledging that this stone had no power to do anything. So if the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) truly worshipped this stone then he should have at least informed his companions that this stone was an idol and that they should pray to it. However, we see that the companions did not do such a thing because the Prophet (peace be upon him) did not promote or believe in such a thing.&nbsp;</font></p>
