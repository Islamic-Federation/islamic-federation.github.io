<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><b><span style="COLOR: navy">In the Bible Genesis 15, we're told that God called Abraham out of &quot;Ur of the Chaldeans&quot;. In Babylonian language, &quot;Ur&quot;, just means city. But in the first century, Jewish Rabbi named Jonathan Ben Uziel was translating Genesis 15 into Aramaic. He came across the word &quot;Ur&quot;, now Johathan did not know Babylonian so he confused the Babylonian word &quot;Ur&quot;, which means &quot;city&quot; with the Hebrew word &quot;Ur&quot;, which means &quot;fire&quot;. This caused him to mistranslate the passage. Instead of saying that God delivered Abraham out of &quot;Ur, city of the Chaldeans&quot;, Jonathan's mistranslation said that God delivered Abraham out of &quot;the fire of the Chaldeans&quot;. Now why is this important? Well, Jewish writers ran with this idea of Abraham escaping from the fire and soon the Talmud contained all kinds of stories of Abraham being thrown into the fire by the Chaldeans and being miraculously rescued by God and these stories were quite popular in Arabia during the time of Muhammad among the Jews living there. And this is crucial because in Surah 21 we read about Abraham being delivered from the fire. Now Muhammad claimed that he was getting this story from God, but we know from history that this entire idea of Abraham being delivered from a fire was based on a mistranslation. So what makes more sense here? That God also mistranslated the word &quot;Ur&quot;? Or that Muhammad was getting his information from the people around him?</span></b><i> </i>(Time Slice: 13:03 - 14:50)</font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="COLOR: navy"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">The Bible itself gives us the answer. In Genesis 15:7, the Lord tells Abraham that it was He who brought Abraham out of Ur of the Chaldeans. Ur is a place, also mentioned in Genesis 11:31. We have evidence that a Jewish scribe named Jonathan Ben Uziel mistook the Hebrew word &quot;Ur&quot; for the Hebrew word which means &quot;fire.&quot; Thus in his commentary of this verse he writes, &quot;I am the Lord who brought you out of the fire of the Chaldeans.&quot;</font></font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="COLOR: navy"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Consequently, because of this misunderstanding, and because of a misreading of the Biblical verse a fable became popular around this era, which stated that God had brought Abraham out of the fire. </font></font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: navy">With this information in hand, we can, therefore, discern where the Jewish fable originated: from a misunderstanding of one word in a Biblical verse by one errant scribe. Yet, somehow this errant understanding found its way into the Qur'an. </span><span style="COLOR: windowtext">(</span><strong>Jay Smith, <i>Is the Qur'an the Word of God? - Part 2</i>, </strong><strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal"><a href="http://www.call-to-monotheism.com/the_qur_an_and_the_city_of_ur__a_rebuttal_to_david_wood/edit/1437/debate.org.uk/topics/history/debate/part2.htm"><b>Source</b></a>)</span> </strong></font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Three responses could be given to this. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The first one is simple and that is that David cannot actually prove that the statement in the Bible itself is true. Even if the Bible is only referring to the city of Ur and not the fire, why should Muslims care if the Qur'an is contradicting the Bible on this point? For all we know, the Bible is wrong and the Qur'an is right. For all we know, the truth could be that Ur is referring to &quot;flame&quot; and the Bible distorted it to only be referring to the city. </font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Secondly, it is actually possible that both statements are true. God did deliver Abraham <b>both </b>out of the city of Ur <b>and</b> the flame, but the Bible only mentions the city. Just because the Bible is silent on the issue of the flame, that doesn't mean that the story is false.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Thirdly, the Biblical passage could very well be interpreted to be referring to the flame of the Chaldeans and not necessarily the city of the Chaldeans. The book of Genesis is originally written in Hebrew. Thus, why would it be wrong to understand &quot;Ur&quot; here according to the Hebrew language? David himself admits that &quot;Ur&quot; in Hebrew, means &quot;fire&quot;. </font></font></p>

It appears to me that since Genesis was written in Hebrew and not in the Babylonian language it would make more sense to understand the word &quot;Ur&quot; as &quot;flame&quot;. However, even if the Bible did make it crystal clear that it was only referring to Ur the city and not the flame, this doesn't make the Bible right and the Qur'an wrong. One would have to prove that the Bible is actually correct on this point. Also, it is possible that God delivered Abraham out of the city <b>and</b> the flame and just because the Bible is silent on the issue of the flame (assuming it is only clearly speaking about the city) that doesn't render the story to be false.</font></p>

If you see above, I offered three different responses to David. </span></h3>
<h3 style="MARGIN: auto 0in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">He tried to rebut my first response:</span></h3>
<br />
<h3 style="MARGIN: auto 0in auto 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><i><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The first one is simple and that is that David cannot actually prove that the statement in the Bible itself is true. Even if the Bible is only referring to the city of <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ur</st1:place></st1:city> and not the fire, why should Muslims care if the Qur'an is contradicting the Bible on this point? For all we know, the Bible is wrong and the Qur'an is right. For all we know, the truth could be that <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ur</st1:place></st1:city> is referring to &quot;flame&quot; and the Bible distorted it to only be referring to the city.</span></i></h3>
<br />
<h3 style="MARGIN: auto 0in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">by repeating his same old worn and torn arguments regarding Islam endorsing the Bible, which have all been sufficiently addressed <a href="http://www.call-to-monotheism.com/does_islam_endorse_the_bible__"><font color="#3333ff">here</font></a> and to which Shamoun didn't even attempt to respond to most of my arguments. </span></h3>
<h3 style="MARGIN: auto 0in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">He tried to rebut my second response:</span></h3>
<br />
<h3 style="MARGIN: auto 0in auto 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><i><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Secondly, it is actually possible that both statements are true. God did deliver Abraham both out of the city of Ur and the flame, but the Bible only mentions the city. Just because the Bible is silent on the issue of the flame, that doesn't mean that the story is false.</span></i></h3>
<br />
<h3 style="MARGIN: auto 0in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">by claiming that the Qur'an says that the Torah is fully detailed, thus it should have mentioned the fact that Abraham was saved from the fire. However, the Muslim position is that the Torah is corrupt and thus it is not difficult to believe that this part of the story is missing. </span></h3>
<br />
<h3 style="MARGIN: auto 0in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Secondly, just as Shamoun doesn't understand the verses that speak about the Qur'an being fully detailed (<a href="http://www.call-to-monotheism.com/rebuttal_to_sam_shamoun_s_article__quran_contradiction__is_the_quran_completely_clear_or_not__">*</a>) it wouldn't be surprising for us to see that he would make the same mistake here. The Torah being fully detailed does not imply that it must record every single event in the life time of the Prophet. Shamoun said: </span></h3>
<br />
<h3 style="MARGIN: auto 0in auto 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><i><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Surely, Abraham being thrown in the fire is one event that God would not forget to mention since it exemplifies the faithfulness and righteous character of God's friend (cf. Isaiah 41:8; James 2:21; Q. 4:125). In fact, this story would go perfectly with Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his beloved son, since they show how loyal and faithful the patriarch was to God from beginning to end.</span></i></h3>
<br />
<h3 style="MARGIN: auto 0in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">And:</span></h3>
<br />
<h3 style="MARGIN: auto 0in auto 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><i><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">This would be similar to omitting the story of Moses' mother placing him in an ark and Pharaoh's daughter finding him, or to Moses killing a man in defense of his fellow Israelite and fleeing <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region> as a result of it.</span></i></h3>
<br />
<h3 style="MARGIN: auto 0in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">This is mere speculation, for Shamoun is assuming that God must have recorded every significant event of Abraham's life. Abraham lived for several years and I am pretty sure that there were several moments of his life where he was preaching to the people that must have been significant and inspiring for everyone to read, but God with His wisdom decided which stories to keep. Allah could have possibly decided that He would want to share this story later on in the Qur'an and not necessarily back then in the Torah. I don't see why this is not a possibility. </span></h3>
<h3 style="MARGIN: auto 0in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">For crying out loud, Shamoun in his <a href="http://www.authenticsunnah.org/sami_trinity_debate_2.mp3"><font color="#3333ff">debate</font></a> with Sami Zaatari even admitted that it is possible that Jesus could have directly and clearly claimed to have been God to the disciples in secret (is there anything that can be more important than this?), but the New Testament authors didn't record it.<br />
<br />
He said:</span></h3>
<br />
<h3 style="MARGIN: auto 0in auto 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; COLOR: navy">Your arguing from silence, right, and absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Now let me repeat that again. Now just because the documents do not say that he said &quot;x&quot; does not mean that he didn't say &quot;x&quot;.</span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 12pt"> </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">(Time Slice: 20<sup>th</sup> minute, 10<sup>th</sup> second onwards)</span></h3>
<br />
<h3 style="MARGIN: auto 0in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">If Shamoun can admit that this is a possibility then why can't he admit that it is possible that Allah didn't want the Torah to mention the story of Abraham escaping from the fire and decide to share it later on to future generations in the Qur'an? Oh yeah I know why, it is because Shamoun as always </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">employs double standards. </span></h3>
<br />
<h3 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">As for my third argument:</span></h3>
<br />
<h3 style="MARGIN: auto 0in auto 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><i><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Thirdly, the Biblical passage could very well be interpreted to be referring to the flame of the Chaldeans and not necessarily the city of the Chaldeans. The book of Genesis is originally written in Hebrew. Thus, why would it be wrong to understand &quot;<st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ur</st1:place></st1:city>&quot; here according to the Hebrew language? David himself admits that &quot;<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Ur</st1:city></st1:place>&quot; in Hebrew, means &quot;fire.&quot;</span></i></h3>
<br />
<h3 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Shamoun goes ahead and attacks strawman:</span></h3>
<br />
<h3 style="MARGIN: auto 0in auto 0.5in"><i><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">How amazing that one of the very sources that Zawadi selectively cited argues that the kind of information found in Genesis concerning the story of Abraham is so accurate that it must be historical, the very thing Zawadi tries to deny!</span></i></h3>
<br />
<h3 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">I challenge Shamoun to point out where in my entire article I denied that this story of Abraham is not historical. If Shamoun remembers my second response:</span></h3>

<br />
<h3 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">I am actually affirming that it is <i>possible </i>that the story is true. </span></h3>
<br />
<h3 style="MARGIN: auto 0in"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">In my third argument, I was arguing that it is at least <i>possible </i>to interpret <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ur</st1:place></st1:city> in the verse to mean &quot;flame&quot;.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">First of all, Shamoun accused me of trying to argue that the story in the Bible is not historic. I never said that. I only said that its fabrication was <b>a possibility and not a certainty. </b>If I was claiming that it was a certainty then I wouldn't have said:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><i>Secondly, it is actually possible that both statements are true. God did deliver Abraham <b>both </b>out of the city of Ur <b>and</b> the flame, but the Bible only mentions the city. Just because the Bible is silent on the issue of the flame, that doesn't mean that the story is false.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Shamoun was making it out to be that I was striving to prove that the story was definitely false, while I wasn't. Thus, my charge against him for attacking straw man stands.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Secondly, Shamoun's source as I already highlighted above is not that convincing since it is mostly based on conjecture. Just because the city of <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ur</st1:place></st1:city> was there during the time of Abraham is not evidence that the story as we find it in the Bible is authentic.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Shamoun says:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><i>As is his habit Zawadi throws one of his own sources under the bus. He now calls into question James Kugel on the grounds that his comments show that he wasn't certain. Zawadi is constantly providing evidence that he is either desperate, and will say anything to defend his position no matter how fallacious, or really suffers from a serious lack of reading comprehension.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I wasn't quoting Kugel in order to prove a point with certainty, but to prove a possibility. Secondly, since when do I have to accept everything that an author says on a particular subject?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Shamoun said:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><i>But now he wants to prove that the oral Torah is another valid source of revelation so as to show that it is possible that Abraham's story was originally a part of it! This merely proves that Zawadi is not seeking truth but will often lie and distort sources in order to defend his false religion and false prophet.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I have no problem believing that certain true statements got their way mixed into other stories. What is the problem with this? I don't believe that the Bible is inspired; yet don't find it hard to believe that it could contain true statements. I don't' see what is wrong in believing the same thing regarding the oral Torah.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><i>More importantly, where does the Quran ever mention Allah giving an oral Torah to Moses or to the Jews?</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Well no where does the Qur'an mention that the Old Testament is the word of God, yet I have no problem believing it contains true statements.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Secondly, Shamoun must stop attacking straw man. I never said that Allah revealed an oral Torah to Moses (peace be upon him). I only said that it is possible that the story found its way into the oral Torah. That is a big difference.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Shamoun then states:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><i>We would like Zawadi to show us that passage. In fact, doesn't his own scripture speak of Allah giving Moses a Book which is fully detailed? Just in case he missed it, here are the texts once again:</i></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><i>And we gave Moses the scripture, complete with the best commandments, <b>and detailing everything</b>, and a beacon and mercy, that they may believe in meeting their Lord. S. 6:154</i></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><i>He said, &quot;O Moses, I have chosen you, out of all the people, with My messages and by speaking to you. Therefore, take what I have given you and be appreciative.&quot; And We wrote for him on the Tablets the lesson to be drawn from all things <b>and the explanation of all things</b> (and said): Hold unto these with firmness, and enjoin your people to take the better therein. I shall show you the habitation of the ungodly. Those who follow the Messenger, the gentile/unlettered Prophet, whom they find mentioned <b>in the Torah and the Gospel WHICH ARE WITH THEM</b>. S. 7:144-145, 157</i></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><i>So what need is there of an oral Torah when the Book of Moses is a fully detailed revelation that contains the explanation of everything?</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">As I clarified previously, I never claimed that Allah revealed an oral Torah. However, I would like to point out that Christians like Shamoun are in trouble. I have written an article over <a href="http://www.call-to-monotheism.com/the_incompleteness_and_incoherence_of_the_bible"><font color="#3333ff">here</font></a> that clearly shows that the textual Torah as Christians have it today cannot be understood without the oral Torah. This shows that there must have been an oral Torah that was revealed, which in turn makes Christians rejecters of God's revelation since they reject the oral Torah (assuming that these were revelations anyways)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Shamoun has failed to show an error in the Qur'an and has only allowed me to show the public the problems in his own faith.</p>
