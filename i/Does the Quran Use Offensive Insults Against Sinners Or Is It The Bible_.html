Let's take a look at some of the verses that they allude to:</span></font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b><u><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Surah 2:65</span></font></u></b></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">And well ye knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath: We said to them: "<b><u>Be ye apes, despised and rejected.</u></b>"</font></p>

<p><b><u><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Surah 5:60</span></font></u></b></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Say: "Shall I point out to you something much worse than this, (as judged) by the treatment it received from God? those who incurred the curse of God and His wrath, those of whom some <b><u>He transformed into apes and swine</u></b>, those who worshipped evil;- these are (many times) worse in rank, and far more astray from the even path!"</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, "<b><u>Those who violated the sanctity of the Sabbath were turned into monkeys</u></b>, then they perished without offspring.'' Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said, "Allah turned them into monkeys <b><u>because of their sins.</u></b> They only lived on the earth for three days, for no transformed person ever lives more than three days. They did not eat, drink or have offspring. Allah transformed their shapes into monkeys, and He does what He wills, with whom He wills and He changes the shape of whomever He wills. On the other hand, Allah created the monkeys, swines and the rest of the creation in the six days (of creation) that He mentioned in His Book.'' </font><b>(Tafsir of Ibn Kathir, <a href="http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=2&amp;tid=2237">Source</a>)</b></font></font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><b><font color="#ff0000">Those Who breached the Sabbath were turned into Monkeys, but Those Who prohibited Their Actions were saved</font></b> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">Allah said that the people of this village were divided into three groups, a group that committed the prohibition, catching fish on the Sabbath, as we described in the Tafsir of Surat Al-Baqarah. Another group prohibited them from transgression and avoided them. A third group neither prohibited them, nor participated in their action. The third group said to the preachers,</font> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">("Why do you preach to a people whom Allah is about to destroy or to punish with a severe torment''). They said, `why do you forbid these people from evil, when you know that they are destroyed and have earned Allah's punishment' Therefore, they said, there is no benefit in forbidding them. The preachers replied,</font> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">("In order to be free from guilt before your Lord (Allah),'') `for we were commanded to enjoin righteousness and forbid evil,' r</font> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">("and perhaps they may fear Allah'') for on account of our advice, they might stop this evil and repent to Allah. Certainly, if they repent to Allah, Allah will accept their repentance and grant them His mercy.' Allah said,</font> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">(So when they forgot the reminder that had been given to them, ) when the evil doers refused the advice,</font> </font></font></p>

<p><font color="#ff0000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">(<b><u>We rescued those who forbade evil, but We seized who did wrong,) who committed the transgression,</u></b> </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">(with a severe torment). <b><u>Allah stated that those who enjoined good were saved, while those who committed the transgression were destroyed,</u></b> but He did not mention the end of those who were passive (the third group), for the compensation is comparable to the deed. This type did not do what would warrant praise, nor commit wrong so that they are admonished. `Ikrimah said, "Ibn `Abbas said about the Ayah: `I do not know whether or not the people were saved who said;</font> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">("Why do you preach to a people whom Allah is about to destroy...'') So I continued discussing it with him until I convinced him that they were. Then he gave me [the gift of] a garment.'' Allah said,</font> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">(and We seized those who did wrong with a Ba'is torment)<b><u> indicating that those who remained were saved. </u></b>As for `Ba'is', it means `severe', according to Mujahid, or `painful', according to Qatadah. These meanings are synonymous, and Allah knows best. Allah said next,</font> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">(despised), humiliated, disgraced and rejected.</font> </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">(167.

They had no dignity or honor and just lived their life based on satisfying their instincts just like animals do. These people did not live as honorable human beings, so God might as well have transformed them into animals. They lived for only three days after this and then they died. It's not like these people lived forever. The ones who did not participate in this sin were saved.</span></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Plus we should not forget that the Quran talks about those true believers from the People of the Book...</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Relate to them the story of the man to whom We sent Our signs, but he passed them by: so Satan followed him up, and he went astray.

<p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Here they say that the Quran insults disbelievers by comparing them to dogs.&nbsp;The verse does not call the individual a dog but compares him to a dog...</font></p>

Therefore his likeness, his description, is as the likeness of a dog: if you attack it, by driving it away or curbing it, it lolls its tongue out, and if you leave it, it lolls its tongue out, and no other animal is like it in this way (both conditional sentences constitute a circumstantial qualifier, that is to say, it has its tongue lolling out despicably in all circumstances. <b><u>The purpose here is to point out the similarity [between the one who follows his whims and a dog] in terms of condition and vileness, judging by the [contextualising] fâ' [of fa-mathaluhu, 'therefore his likeness']</u></b>, which relates what comes after it to what came before it in the way of 'inclining towards this world and following whims', and judging by God's saying: That, likeness, is the likeness of those people who deny Our signs.
