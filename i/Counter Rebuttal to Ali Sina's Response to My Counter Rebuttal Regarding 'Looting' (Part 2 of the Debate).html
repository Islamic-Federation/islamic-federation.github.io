<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I don't know what constitutes kindness for Muslims. Raiding innocent civilians, killing unarmed people taken by surprise, or massacring their entire male population and enslaving their women and children and even raping them are not acts of kindness. The claim that Islam promotes kindness is an insult to human intelligence. This is like saying Nazism promotes kindness. Islam has advanced by terror and not by kindness. The order to cast terror in the heart of the enemy is mandated in the Quran </font><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/003.qmt.html#003.151"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3.151</font></a><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">, </font><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/008.qmt.html#008.012"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8.12</font></a><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">. The enemy is anyone who Muhammad chose to attack. These people did not have to be hostile to Muhammad or have done anything against him. He decided that those who do not submit to his cult are the enemy and must be subdued. Or those who are wealthy are the enemy.&nbsp; Muhammad boasted "I have been made victorious with terror" <i>Bukhari </i></font></font><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/052.sbt.html#004.052.220"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4:52:220</font></a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Yes, if a law in a hadith is contradicts the Quran, the latter is to be taken as authority. However here we are not talking about laws but about events and the actions of Muhammad. The Quran is the collection of Muhammad's sayings attributed to Allah and the hadith is the collection of Muhammad's sayings and his deeds as reported by his companions. Sometimes Muhammad's words are good, but often his actions are not. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Any criminal will tell you doing evil is wrong. Such statement does not make him a good person. He is simply a man whose actions and words do not match. When I was a boy, back in my country of birth, there was a radio program called 'A City within Our City'. Every week the producer interviewed one prisoner, often on death roll. The prisoners explained what made them become attracted to crime. At the end of each interview he would ask the inmates if they had an advice for the youths. The advices of these criminals were all good. I thought sarcastically, if we only listened to the advices of these criminals, the world would become paradise.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Words are cheap. Actions are what matter. A man who does not walk his own talk is a despicable man. In matters of law, if there is discrepancy between the Quran and the Haidth, the former is the authority. But if&nbsp; you find in the Quran Muhammad says it is meritorious to manumit the slaves and then you read in the Hadith that he raided people, looted them, massacred them and reduced thousand upon thousands of them into slaves, what shall we make of it? We can't dismiss the Hadith and deny that they are not true just because in the Quran Muhammad says something else. We can conclude that he was a contemptible man whose words and deeds did not match. We can't disregard all the gory stories of crimes committed by this degenerate fiend just because somewhere he said; "be kind to others". The question is why he did not walk the talk? If he knew kindness is better than cruelty, why he acted so ruthlessly? Did he really mean it or he said it to feign holiness?</font><!--?XML:NAMESPACE PREFIX = O /--><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> &nbsp;</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Terror here is the fear that Allah has put into the hearts of the disbelievers and not the kind of terror that Ali Sina wants us to assume.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">This is what the early commentators of this hadith and the early scholars and the people that knew Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) know what the Prophet meant when he said that.

<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">If you believe that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the author of the Quran and Muhammad (peace be upon him) wanted to go around killing everyone then why didn't Muhammad teach that in the Quran?

<p><b><u><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">Ali Sina said:</font></u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">In response to me saying the battles of Muhammad were raids (qazwah) Mr. al Zawadi wrote:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i><font color="#800080">"<!--?XML:NAMESPACE PREFIX = ST1 /--><st1:city w:st="on"> <st1:place w:st="on">Battle</st1:place> </st1:city>of Uhud was not a raid. <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Battle</st1:place> </st1:city>of the Trench was not a raid. <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Battle</st1:place> </st1:city>of Badr was not a raid."</font></i></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Muhammad waged over sixty wars according to Tabari.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With the exception of Uhud and Khandaq (Trench), all of them were offensive and raids. The Battle of Badr was intended to be a raid against the caravan of the Quraish. Abu Sufyan, the head of the caravan dodged the attack by detouring the caravan. The Meccans learned about Muhammad's intention and they came to defend their caravan. The battle of Uhud and Khandaq were legitimate wars. After the Meccans had enough of Muhammad's forays, they came to punish him for his constant taunting of their caravans and his lootings. Unlike Muhammad's raids that were unannounced, the Meccans informed their enemy of their intention,&nbsp; giving him plenty of leeway to prepare. The war of Khandaq was not fought and the Meccans went back. So what if two out of 67 wars of Muhammad were not raids? Does this acquit him of being a highway robber and a marauding gangster? This is like a criminal accused of more than three scores of armed robberies, murders and assassinations plead innocence on the ground that in two occasions he had to fight back in self defense when his victims turned against him.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">In that case Mr. al Zawadi should read the Sira again. With the exception of Khandaq and Uhud, virtually all the wars of Muhammad were depredatory. The attack on Mecca was also technically a raid. In this case the population was taken by surprise. A deal was made between the traitor Abbas who was the fifth column in Mecca spying for Muhammad from the start, Abu Sufyan who felt that with 10,000 men at the gates of Mecca there is no chance to win the war and Muhammad. This deal was agreed outside the town in Muhammad's tent. The people of Mecca did not know about this deal and when Abu Sufyan said the city must capitulate to avoid bloodshed, his wife cursed him and said he is not a man. The Meccans were taken by surprise. They had singed a treaty with Muhammad and did not expect a war. Muhammad suddenly appeared at their gates with his army demanding them to surrender or face death. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The killing of the Jews of Medina technically were not raids. He did not raid them but he laid siege on their quarters and cut the supply of water to them until they surrendered and then he banished them or massacred them.</font></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Verdana Ref&#39;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Muslim, in his collection of Sahih Hadith narrates the following:</font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Verdana Ref&#39;"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Ibn 'Aun reported: I wrote to Nafi' inquiring from him whether it was necessary to extend (to the disbelievers) an invitation to accept (Islam) before meeting them in fight. He wrote (in reply) to me that it was necessary in the early days of Islam. <font color="#ff0000">The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) made a raid upon Banu Mustaliq while they were unaware and their cattle were having a drink at the water.</font> He killed those who fought and imprisoned others. On that very day, he captured Juwairiya bint al-Harith. Nafi' said that this tradition was related to him by Abdullah b. Umar who (himself) was among the raiding troops."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></font></font><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/019.smt.html#019.4292"><span style="FONT-STYLE: normal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Muslim 19, 4292</font></span></a><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> &nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Here the phrase "he killed those who fought" is misleading. This may give the idea that these people were armed and prepared to fight. Not so! People were caught by surprise and unarmed. This was an act of terrorism and not a war.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b><u><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">My Response:</font></u></b></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Raid or battle, the challenge remains. When did the Prophet ever attack anyone that did nothing or were going to do nothing wrong to him or the Muslims first?&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Why doesn't Ali Sina mention the fact that the Prophet had the ability and power to kill all the Meccans in the city if he wished, but he was so merciful that he forgave them all even though they thought he was going to kill them?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">As for the Jews of Madinah I made an article filled with links that talk about and address those issues </font><a href="http://www.call-to-monotheism.com/the_jewish_tribes_of_madinah"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">here</font></a><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Ali Sina said that when the hadith said that those men from the Banu Mustalaq were armed and fought is a lie and that they were unarmed. Where on earth is your evidence Ali? Do you call this a rebuttal? Seriously, are you kidding me? You accept the part of the hadith that supports your argument but reject the parts that don't? Is this logical and fair debating? What kind of debating skills and arguments are you giving? If you accept a source you either accept all of it or reject all of it. If you want to accept parts of it then you must have some evidence for doing so. Your personal and biased opinions carry no weight.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">Ali Sina said:</font></u></b></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Actually it was not necessary even in the early days of Islam to warn the victims. The forays of the caravans were not announced. In Nakhlah Muhammad left the instruction to raid the caravan with no warning and in the sacred month when war was sacrilege. This was one of the early raids.

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">My opponent quotes Ibn Hisham who wrote: </font></font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">News reached the Prophet [pbuh] on Sha'ban 2nd. to the effect that the chief of Bani Al-Mustaliq, Al-Harith bin Dirar had mobilised his men, along with some Arabs, to attack Madinah. Buraidah bin Al-Haseeb Al-Aslami was immediately despatched to verify the reports. He had some words with Abi Dirar, who confirmed his intention of war. He later sent a reconnoiterer to explore the positions of the Muslims but he was captured and killed. The Prophet [pbuh] summoned his men and ordered them to prepare for war. Before leaving, Zaid bin Haritha was mandated to see to the affairs of Madinah and dispose them. On hearing the advent of the Muslims, the disbelievers got frightened and the Arabs going with them defected and ran away to their lives. Abu Bakr was entrusted with the banner of the Emigrants, and that of the Helpers went to Sa'd bin 'Ubada. The two armies were stationed at a well called Muraisi. Arrow shooting went on for an hour, and then the Muslims rushed and engaged with the enemy in a battle that ended in full victory for the Muslims. Some men were killed, women and children of the disbelievers taken as captives, and a lot of booty fell to the lot of the Muslims. Only one Muslim was killed by mistake by a Helper. Amongst the captives was Juwairiyah, daughter of Al-Harith, chief of the disbelievers. The Prophet [pbuh] married her and, in compensation, the Muslims had to manumit a hundred others of the enemy prisoners who embraced Islam, and were then called the Prophet's in-laws. [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/112,113; Ibn<span style="COLOR: black"> Hisham 2/289,290,294,295]</span></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is important to note that Muhammad <b>fabricated excuses</b> for his attacks. In all these excuses he shifted the blame on his victims. For example, when he attacked the Bani Qaynuqa the excuse was that a couple of them had disrespected a Muslim woman. When he attacked the Bani Nadir the excuse was that Angel Gabriel had whispered in his ears that the Bani Nadir were plotting to kill him. When he attacked the Bani Quraiza his excuse was that they had confabulated with the Meccans. This is typical mindset of the narcissist. Narcissists always have excuses for their evil deeds. The claim that Muhammad pre-empted an attack by the Bani Mustaliq is a fabrication of Muhammad himself. It is just an excuse based on a lie. The Bani Mustaliq had no reason to attack Medina. It was always Muhammad who initiated the wars and hostilities. The Bani Mustaliq were not interested in Islam and religious wars in <st1:place w:st="on">Arabia</st1:place> did not exist prior to Islam. They were Jews. They were an educated and cultured people. They were artisans, herdsmen and farmers. They had made their wealth in commerce and in industry, not through marauding. What reason had they to attack Medina, a city impoverish by Muhammad whose citizens had all become thieves and highway robbers? These are lies concocted by Muhammad to convince his foolish followers that his forays were justified. Despite their savagery, the early believers were still humans and must have felt raiding, massacring and pillaging innocent people with no justification is not right. Muhammad had to give them an excuse. When you attack someone, you must have an excuse. Even Hitler had reasons for his attacks. His reason was "to bring civilization to the less evolved people of the world". The reasons Muhammad gave for his raids were just excuses. With these lies his foolhardy followers placated their conscience willingly and descended to new depths of barbarity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The above give you a glimpse into the mind of a psychopathic narcissist. Narcissists always blame their victims and have justification for their evil deeds. The followers of Muhammad have entered into his narcissistic bubble universe and <b>all of them</b>, to the degree that they emulate him, evince his psychopathology. They deny the evil deeds of their prophet and justify his crimes and their own. See the parts that I highlighted with red and blue! He is saying that Muhammad had no choice but to attack, kill, torture, rape, and enslave his victims. The way he has worded it one might as well think that Muhammad was the victim. .&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Don't just assume that Mr. al Zawadi is talking nonsense. On the contrary, this is how narcissists think. The psychopath narcissist always blames his victims. "he made me do it", is his alibi. The psychopath feels justified to punish you if you resist his demands.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">These are all lies, excuses to assail and mug an entire population of innocent civilians, loot their wealth and take them as slaves and sex slaves.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">For the sake of argument, let us say the leaders of Khaibar were responsible for the "uprising of armies against the Muslims in the<st1:place w:st="on"> Battle</st1:place> of the Trench" (This is of course a lie. Muhammad already massacred all the men of Bani Quraiza and enslaved all their wives and children with the same excuse. Khaibar had nothing to do with the battle of the Trench. The Jews never raised against the Muslims in Medina or anywhere in Arabia and they tried to stay neutral at all times. That was of course a grave error that cost them their lives.) Does this justify to invade a city and massacre its citizens? Does it justify taking their women as sex slaves and forcing the elderly and the unwanted women to till their own confiscated land and and give half of the produce to their conqueror?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Let us read the story of this raid as described in a hadith. Whatever you find in parenthesis are the interpolations of the translator. These are introduced to soften the tone and to justify Muhammad's crimes. For example whenever the hadith talks about 'raid' the words (enemy) and (hostile) are interpolated next to it. This gives an impression that these people were the enemies and Muslims had to fight these wars were in self defense. That is not so. Any person who did not submit to Muhammad was considered to be an enemy. The terrorists are not killing innocent people; they are killing "the enemy". In Khaibar, people had no idea that Muhammad was about to attack them until he was in their lanes with his men on their horses slaying anyone at sight. Just like the gullible westerners of today, the non Muslims of Arabia 1400 years ago, did not know they are "the enemy" and the target.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></font></p>

<div><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">" While describing the battle of Khaibar, the histoy writers have commited a serious blunder in reporting a totally baseless report, which has become a common place. It is said that the Prophet ( Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had granted amnesty to the Jews on condition that they would not hide anything. When Kinana Ibn Rabi' refused to give any clue to the hidden treasures, the Prophet ( peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ordered Zubair to adopt stern measures to force a disclosure. Zubair branded his chest with a hot flint again and again, till he was on the point of death. At last he ordered Kinana to be put to death and all the Jews were made slaves.</font> </font></font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">The whole truth in the story is that Kinana was put to death. But it was not for his refusal to give a clue to the hidden treasure. He was put to death because he had killed Mahmud Ibn Maslama (also Muslima). Tabari had reported it in unambigious words: " Then the Holy Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave Kinana to Muhammad Ibn Maslama (Muslima), " and he put him to death in retaliation of the murder of his own brother, Mahmud Ibn Maslama (Muslima)."</font> </font></font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000"><b><u>In the rest of the report, both Tabari and Ibn Hisham have quoted it from Ibn Ishaq, but Ibn Ishaq does not name any narrator.</u></b> Traditionists, in books on Rijal, have explicitely stated that Ibn Ishaq used to borow from the jews stories concerning the battle of the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). As Ibn Ishaq does not mention the name of any narrator whatseoever in this case, there is every likelihood of the story of having been passed on by the Jews.</font> </font></font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">That a man should be tortured with burns on his chest by the sparks of a flint is too heinous a deed for a Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who had earned for himself the title of Rahma'lil Alamin (Mercy for all the worlds). After all, did he not let the woman who had sought to poisin him go scot free. Who would expect such a soul to order human body to be so burnt for the sake of a few coins.</font> </font></font></div>

He had also given his word, according to one of the reports, tha tif he did anything to the contrary, he could be put to death. Kinana played false, and the immunity granted to him was withdrawn.

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This is yet another lie. The Arabs prior to Islam were not as ruthless as Muhammad and his followers. At no time in the history of Arabia Arabs had shown this much savagery that they demonstrated stirred by the teachings of Muhammad. This claim that "t<i>he pagans would have done the same</i>" is a lie. As I said above, it is the typical alibi of the narcissist for his own crimes. The narcissist thinks everyone is like him. He thinks others would also break the Golden Rule, are thieves and dishonest, are ruthless and inhumane just as he is. So he feels that since others would do the same he is completely justified to do it to them preemptively. We have no evidence that the non-Muslims of <st1:place w:st="on">Arabia</st1:place> had been unfair or cruel to Muslims. It has been always the other way round. The claim of persecution is false, as I have demonstrated elsewhere.

<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Now did I or did I not provide a link to the Tafsir of that Hadith which is done by one of the most prominent Muslims scholars who had evidence and narrations that stated exactly what happened? This is the second time that Ali Sina does this. I refute him using the very same sources that he uses but when they go against him he says that they are fabricated. No evidence at all. No evidence what so ever. This is not a serious debate. I clearly showed from the teachings of the Quran that you cannot harm a person more than he harms you. If the Prophet did not believe in that then he shouldn't have taught that. The Prophet followed and abided by the Quran. This is proven by the evidence. Ali Sina is just too desperate that he goes and discredits it with no evidence for doing so. He offered no evidence for why those narrations are false.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">He said that Arabs back then were not brutal. There are always brutal people in a society.&nbsp; Especially when they are armed robbers going around murdering people.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Maybe my English was poor here. What I meant to say was that the Prophet (peace be upon him) did not punish people only because they merely insulted him. A lot of people insulted the Prophet (peace be upon him).

<p><b><u><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">Ali Sina said:</font></u></b></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Muhammad was a psychopath. Being a psychopath does not mean acting erratically. Psychopaths are often smart and calculating. Hitler was a psychopath. But he was not a fool. Saddam Hussein is a psychopath, but as one can see, he is very smart. Most psychopaths do not kill for no reason or just for the fun of it as one can see in movies. Some do. Son of Sam or the Unibomber are examples of that. Some psychopaths kill because this gives them the godlike power of taking lives. But even they are smart. Most psychopaths look normal and they are often more successful than the average people because they are calculating and ruthless. They successfully deceive and&nbsp; embezzle others and because they have thought of everything from the start, when no one had a slightest idea that they will be stabbed in the back, they get away with their embezzlements. Because they can play their cards extremely well, they often rise to power. In countries where they can fool the masses they become dictators, where dictatorship is not possible they become CEOs. They are smart and charming, but ruthless and conniving.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">When psychopath narcissists kill, they always have "legitimate" reasons that to them make perfect sense. They kill those whom they think intervene in their grandiose plans. They think of themselves so important and their ideas so grand that those who stand in their way become dispensable and must be eliminated. They feel perfectly justified to do that and are convinced of their actions. Their cause is so important that the lives of millions of people become insignificant in comparison.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">What would Muhammad gain by killing wantonly all the captives of Badr? Many of those captives were the relatives of his followers. One of them was Abul Aas, husband of Zeinab, his own elder daughter. <b>Muhammad asked the families of the prisoners to pay ransom for their release <font color="#ff0000">or he would kill them</font></b><font color="#ff0000">.</font> He saved them out of greed, not out of kindness of heart!</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#ff0000" size="3">The ransom for the prisoners ranged between 4000 and 1000 Dirhams in accordance with the captive's financial situation. Another form of ransom assumed an educational dimension; most of the Makkans, unlike the Madinese, were literate and so each prisoner who could not afford the ransom was entrusted with ten children to teach them the art of writing and reading. Once the child had been proficient enough, the instructor would be set free. Another clan of prisoners were released unransomed on grounds of being hard up.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Don't blame them. They are victims of this poison. Blame yourself. You are guilty too for letting them vitiate their minds with this venom. They can't help it. But you can help them. Why don't you?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Take a look at what is going on in our own time. Muslims are massacring innocent people all over the world with their terrorist acts and yet they claim they are under attack and what they do is "self defense". This is how the psychopathic minds of the Muslims work. You can't understand that unless you have been a Muslim at least for a few years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is not a normal way of thinking and that is why our strategists and political analysts are failing to address the problem. The problem of Islamic terrorism is not political. It must be studied as psychopathology, not as a political problem. The mind of a psychopath does not work in quite the same way that healthy minds work. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Here what I am saying is that the followers of Muhammad are psychologically and emotionally mangled. This statement is very much politically incorrect. This sounds extreme and anyone saying that could be accused of racism. To hell with political correctness. Political correctness mean lying when telling the truth is offensive. But a lie is lie. It is the lies of political correctness that is killing us. Unless we see Islam as a sick cult and Muslims as sick people, we can't address this problem and the Islamic terrorism will continue to claim more lives. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The problem of Islamic terrorism, is not just political but also religious and consequently emotional and psychological. We need experts in psychology, precisely those who have experience in cults to understand the Muslim mind and to pull us out of this muddle.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Do you see the pattern? It is always the fault of the victims.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">The reason women and children were caught in the battle tells us that unlike what Muslim historians had stated, these poor people were not coming to war. No sane person would take all his family and all his belonging to war. Muslim historians have claimed that the leader of the Hawazin insisted to carry the women and children to make his men "determined in their fight". This is ludicrous. We are talking of a tribe with over ten thousand people. Would all these people obey a decision so insane? </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Why would they want to attack an army of Muslims? What would they gain in this? The accusation makes no sense. You don't have to be a genius to see that Muslim historians lie when they shift the blame on their victims.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">These are all excuses to justify the crimes committed by Muhammad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>See how my opponent, with straight face, blames the victims for bringing along their women and children? Does this justify to take them as prisoners and enslave them? Where is the conscience of these people? There is not a shred of humanity left in them. These are not the people that we could share the planet with, let alone our countries. What kind of value will they bring to our world? The world has come out of barbarity and obscurantism for centuries and these people want to take us back. They belong to another world, a world very demonic and evil.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">As usual through out this debate when Ali Sina is faced with sources that go against him he rejects it. It is documented history that the tribe of Hawazin were marching against the Muslim army in order to attack them. They also brought with their women and children among with them. Ali Sina also said that they were not coming to war. Then how does he explain how the tribe of Hawazin ended up in the valley of Hunayn. What were they doing there?</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#ff0000" size="3">The chief of the Hawazin Malik ibn Awf ordered his men as they were leaving for the confrontation, to bring along with them their women, children and wealth, so that every man might be aware of them behind them as he fought and not flee from the battle field.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#ff0000" size="3">Durayd ibn Summah, an experienced warrior, objected to this, saying: "Will anything stop the defeated from fleeing.

Either we become like them and embrace their cult, which of course means perpetual wars as Muslims have killed more of their own than they have killed others, do nothing until they kill us or reduce us into slavery and dhimmitude or kill them first.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Which one you like best? These are our options. Are these sane options? If you embrace Islam, as Salman Rushdie puts it, "this least huggable of faiths", you will lose everything you cherish. You will lose your freedom and should kiss goodbye your culture and your civilization for it will be demonized and vilified as <i>taghooti</i> (satanic) and <i>jahilliah </i>(ignorance). Religious police will walk in the streets telling you that your dress is not Islamicly right and will beat you for exposing a few strands of hair. You could even be </font><a href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/Announcement/510311736.htm"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">shot on the spot and killed for eating during the month of Ramadan.</font></a><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> Look at Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the Afghanistan of the Taliban - this is Islam. A state run by sharia law is hell.&nbsp;You will be ruled by people like Mr. Bassam al Zawadi, Ahmadinejad and Mullah Omar and opposition to them means opposition to God and you will be jailed or killed. You will have to accept that Arabs are master race, just as today the Pakistanis, the Bangladeshis, the Malays and the Indonesians have accepted it wholeheartedly. Persians have not. They invented their own version of Islam to vilify Arabs and not to submit to them as slaves. At least a shred of dignity is left in Iranians. Frankly my friend, death is better than that life.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">If you don't convert to Islam, you will be subdued, and forced to work and sustain the Islamic state with Jizyah (a penalty tax levied on non-Muslims).

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Today I received a copy of a chilling email that is being circulated among some Australians.

How this should be done is blood curling. &nbsp;Here are a few passages of that message:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The coals were lit when lebs threatened to rape young children on Cronulla beach; lifeguards stepped in to defend them and were bashed. This has been going on for years.<br>
<br>
The comoncheros and Bra Boys have as of today given official support to gang rapists and thus must be destroyed if they interfere. They are a group of old has-been, race traitors, junkies and lebs. Aussie Patriots do not need their support.<br>
<br>
Failure to fight and win will mean living under the rule of criminals and gang rapists.<br>
<br>
This is a real war, make no mistake. cowards WILL BE TREATED LIKE LEBS!<br>
<br>
Bring yourself, your mates, anyone you know of fighting age and whatever devices you see fit to defend yourself and your country.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">After rallying in Cronulla and Maroubra we will push our way through to Lakemba and Bankstown, <font color="#ff0000">we will destroy the mosques in these areas and any leb that gets in our way. We will smash their houses, smash their shops, destroy their ghettos.</font></font></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">The message continues with more angry notes and calls to violence against the Lebanese and Muslims.&nbsp; </font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">The person who forwarded this message to me, although said she does not support violence, unreservedly agreed with the spirit of this message. </font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">The same is happening in <st1:place u2:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place> </st1:place>. Racism and blind nationalism is again on the rise. Some good people are dragged into it. We have a difficult time ahead of us.

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Is this the way we want to go? What has happened to our species? Is this what is called intelligent life? What part of this is intelligent? Do we have to become beasts and murder our own kind just to survive? Which one of these options is better? </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">I am offering you another alternative - an alternative that requires neither blood nor slavery. Islam is a disease. It's the disease that we have to eradicate. Why everybody is afraid to attack the disease itself?&nbsp; </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Obviously we can't let the sick infect the world with his deadly disease or the mad man go loose shooting and killing people. But should we kill him? Is this the sane way to cure a sick person?&nbsp; </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">For the sake of sanity, why instead of killing the patient, don't we try to cure him from his sickness? Why don't we eradicate Islam? Islam is the disease of the soul and the mind. Islam is the disease that has crippled mankind. A billion people follow a psychopath. This is insanity. This is not comical; it's calamity. Muslims are infirm. But we do not kill infirm people.&nbsp; </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">The problem seems to be huge but the solution is ironically simple. All we have to do is to destroy Islam. That is not an impossible task. We can do that, if we just tell the truth. It's as simple as that. We are getting drowned in a glass of water. The solution to all this madness is to tell the truth. Our governments must start telling the truth. The politicians and the media must start telling the truth. In schools, we should teach the truth. The truth is not subjective. There is no 'your truth' and 'my truth'. When it comes to history, facts are the truth. History must be taught honestly and factually.&nbsp; </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">The non-Muslims are not entirely sane either. They too have their own mental sickness. They are suffering from political correctness. This combination is lethal. Compare Islam to human immunodeficiency virus HIV and political correctness to immunodeficiency. Political correctness can kill us. It lowers our resistance against the enemy and will make us vulnerable to its advances. The foolish defenders of Muslims are just as dangerous as Muslims. Truth can cure both of them. Those who suffer from political correctness and those who suffer from Islam can both benefit from it and recover.&nbsp; </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Those who find the truth too bitter to swallow must be <b>force-fed. </b>The truth is their medicine. This medicine must reach them willingly or unwillingly. Because their sickness is affecting all of us, they must not have a choice. They must hear it until they recover. The best place to start force feeding the truth is in prison compounds where the terrorists are detained. Don't torture them. Tell them the truth about Islam and once that truth sinks, they will cooperate. Tell them the truth about Islam and they will leave terrorism. It is Islam that converts good people into terrorists and makes them monsters. How to do that? Very simple! Produce radio programs in their own language and make them listen to it several hours per day, every day. We at FFI can produce the right programs. We know how to handle the Muslims and what to tell them. This is how they have been brainwashed. We can un-brainwash them in the same way.&nbsp; </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">We must get rid of Islam if we want to avoid a major bloodshed and our species survive.
