Will you intercede for us with your Lord so that He may relieve us from this place of ours?' Adam will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking.' He will mention his mistakes he had committed, i.e., his eating off the tree though he had been forbidden to do so. He will add, 'Go to Noah, the first prophet sent by Allah to the people of the Earth.' The people will go to Noah who will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking.' He will mention his mistake which he had done, i.e., his asking his Lord without knowledge. He will say (to them), 'Go to Abraham, Khalil Ar-Rahman.' They will go to Abraham who will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking.' He would mention three words by which he told a lie, and say (to them). 'Go to Moses, a slave whom Allah gave the Torah and spoke to, directly and brought near Him, for conversation.'</FONT></SPAN></P>

They will go to Jesus who will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking but you'd better go to Muhammad the slave whose past and future sins have been forgiven by Allah.' So they will come to me, and I will ask my Lord's permission to enter His House and then I will be permitted. When I see Him I will fall down in prostration before Him, and He will leave me (in prostration) as long as He will, and then He will say, 'O Muhammad, lift up your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted, and ask (for anything) for it will be granted:' Then I will raise my head and glorify my Lord with certain praises which He has taught me. Allah will put a limit for me (to intercede for a certain type of people) <B>I WILL TAKE THEM OUT AND MAKE THEM ENTER PARADISE</B>."

<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"><FONT face="Times New Roman">... So it is possible that Muhammad - Allah bless and greet him - was specifically brought out from the loins of Adam before the spirit was breathed into the latter, for Muhammad - Allah bless and greet him - is the purpose (<I>al-maqsud</I>) in the creation of the human species, he is its very essence (`<I>aynuhu</I>), quintessence (<I>khulasatuhu</I>), and core (<I>wasita `aqdih</I>). And it has been narrated that Adam - upon him peace - saw the name of Muhammad - Allah bless and greet him - written on the Throne and that Allah - Almighty and Glorified - said to Adam: "Were it not for Muhammad I would not have created you." Al-Hakim narrated it in his <I>Sahih</I> [see its documentation in the <I>Encyclopedia of Islamic Doctrine</I> 4:36-41].</FONT></SPAN></P>

This is why some have said that "Allah created the Universe due to him," or that "Were it not for him, He would have neither created a Throne, nor a Footstool, nor a heaven, earth, sun or moon." However, this is not a hadith on the authority of the Prophet - Allah bless and greet him -... but it may be explained from a correct aspect...</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"><FONT face="Times New Roman">"Since the best of the righteous of the children of Adam is Muhammad - Allah bless and greet him -, creating him was a desirable end of deeep-seated purposeful wisdom, more than for anyone else, and hence the completion of creation and the fulfillment of perfection was attained with Muhammad, may Allah Exalted bless him and grant him peace... The Chief of the Children of Adam is Muhammad, may Allah Exalted bless him and grant him peace, Adam and his children being under his banner. He, may Allah Exalted bless him and grant him peace, said: "Truly, I was written as the Seal of the Prophets with Allah, when Adam was going to-and-fro in his clay," i.e. that my prophethood was decreed and manifested when Adam - upon him peace - was created but before the breathing of the Spirit into him, just as Allah decrees the livelihood, lifespan, deeds and misery or happiness of the slave when He creates the embryo but before the breathing of the spirit into it.</FONT></SPAN></P>

Thus it cannot be denied to say that "Due to him all of this was created", or that "Were it not for him, all this would not have been created," so if statements like this are thus explained according to what the Book and the Sunna indicate, it is acceptable."

<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"><FONT face="Times New Roman">The Mother of the Book is the source of all knowledge, including the Divine Scriptures. It is the essential knowledge of Allah before He created creation. This is why it is said to have been written fifty thousand years before the creation of the cosmos, a symbolic number, since without stars and planets there cannot be days and years as we understand them. Allah conceived His creation in the darkness of non-existence, then with the light of His creative act brought them out into existence. Thus the First Light was created, a being appearing against the dark background of non-existence. "The first thing that Allah created was the Intellect,"[3] said the Prophet, may Allah's blessings and peace be upon him. He also said, "The first thing that Allah created was the Pen," which amounts to the same thing, since the first intellect is the primordial light in its passive aspect as recipient of the knowledge of what is to be, while the Pen is the primordial light in its active aspect of writing this knowledge on the Guarded Tablet at Allah's command. "The first thing that Allah created was the Pen and He said to it: Write! So it wrote what is to be forever."[4] From this First light all of creation, with all its varied forms and meanings till the end of time unfolds.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"><FONT face="Times New Roman">This primordial light is what is called the Light of the Prophet, may Allah's blessings and peace be upon him, since he is the created being who received the major share of it.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"><FONT face="Times New Roman">This light was also the origin of the lights of all other Divine Messengers, of the angels, then of all other beings. This is how the Prophet, may Allah's blessings and peace be upon him, could say, "I was a Prophet when Adam was still between spirit and body."[5] The power of this light made the Prophet's radiation so powerful, once he appeared on earth, that Allah calls him in the Qur'ân "<I>an illuminating lamp</I>." Allah describes the sun and the moon in the Qur'ân in like manner explaining what He means when He says that He made the Prophet "<I>an illuminating lamp</I>" ...</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"><FONT face="Times New Roman">Some of the Prophet's Companions were given to see this light as even brighter than both the sun and moon, for when they walked with him they noticed that he cast no shadow on the ground.[10] Those who saw him in the full moon noticed that his blessed face was brighter than the moon,[11] and one of his Companions, the Lady Rubayyi', when asked to describe him, said, "My son, had you seen him, you would have seen the sun shining."[12] ...</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"><FONT face="Times New Roman">The light of the Prophet, may Allah's blessings and peace be upon him, manifested itself in his parents before and during his birth. His biographers have recorded that his father's forehead shone with a light that a certain women from Quraysh noticed. She knew that the appearance of the Prophet of the End of Time was imminent and felt that 'Abdallah's forehead signalled his being the father. She offered herself to him, but he refused. Soon `Abdallah married Amina and, once she became pregnant with the Prophet, the light vanished from his forehead. He met the same woman again and, noticing she no longer wanted him, asked her why. She replied that he no longer carried that light on his forehead.[25] As for the Lady Amina, when she became pregnant, she saw in a dream-vision that a light came out of her that lit the land as far north as Syria.[26] She was also told in her dream that she was pregnant with the master of this nation and the sign of that would be that when she gave birth to him she would see a light coming out with him that would shine over Bosra in Syria. "When this happens", she was told, "call him Muhammad!"[27] "I conceived him, " she said, "and suffered no pain until delivery. When he came out of me, a light came out with him that illuminated everything from East to West."[28] She also said, "I saw the night I gave birth to him a light that illuminated the palaces of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Syria</st1:country-region></st1:place> so that I saw them."[29] The Prophet later confirmed this, saying, "My mother saw, when she gave birth to me, a light that illuminated the palaces of Bosra."[30] This event is also a very clear indication of the spiritual rank of the Lady Amina, for to see the palaces of Bosra in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Syria</st1:country-region></st1:place> from Macca demands the spiritual vision of sanctity.

The Jews came to Allah's Apostle and 'Abdullah went inside the house. Allah's Apostle asked (the Jews), "What kind of man is 'Abdullah bin Salam amongst you?"
