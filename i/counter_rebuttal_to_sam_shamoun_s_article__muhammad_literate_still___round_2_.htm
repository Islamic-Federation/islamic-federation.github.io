<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>First, let us highlight the parts that Zawadi conveniently overlooked:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>"In the third year of Cyrus king of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Persia</st1:place></st1:country-region> a word was revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshaz'zar. <B><U>And the word was true, and it was a great conflict</U></B>. And he understood the word and had understanding of the vision. In those days I, Daniel, <B><U>was mourning for three weeks. I ate no delicacies, no meat or wine entered my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, for the full three weeks</U></B>." Daniel 10:1-3</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Notice that Daniel had been fasting for three weeks because he had been in mourning over what he had seen in a previous vision. This may explain why he was so weak and couldn't stand up, that his weak physical condition along with seeing the angelic envoys accounts for his falling to the ground. Moreover, notice what the angel did for Daniel:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>"On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river, that is, the <st1:place w:st="on">Tigris</st1:place>, I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with gold of Uphaz. His body was like beryl, his face like the appearance of lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and the sound of his words like the noise of a multitude. And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision, but a great trembling fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves. So I was left alone and saw this great vision, and no strength was left in me; my radiant appearance was fearfully changed, AND I RETAINED NO STRENGTH. Then I heard the sound of his words; and when I heard the sound of his words, I fell on my face in a deep sleep with my face to the ground. And behold, a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees. And he said to me, 'O Daniel, man greatly beloved, give heed to the words that I speak to you, AND STAND UPRIGHT, for now I have been sent to you.' <B><U>While he was speaking this word to me, I stood up trembling. Then he said to me, 'FEAR NOT, Daniel</U></B>, for from the first day that you set your mind to understand and humbled yourself before your God, your words have been heard, and I have come because of your words. The prince of the <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">kingdom</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Persia</st1:PlaceName> withstood me twenty-one days; but Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, so I left him there with the prince of the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">kingdom</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Persia</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> and came to make you understand what is to befall your people in the latter days. For the vision is for days yet to come.' When he had spoken to me according to these words, I turned my face toward the ground and was dumb. And behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips; then I opened my mouth and spoke. I said to him who stood before me, 'O my lord, by reason of the vision pains have come upon me, and I retain no strength. How can my lord's servant talk with my lord? For now no strength remains in me, and no breath is left in me.' <B><U>Again one having the appearance of a man touched me AND STRENGTHENED ME. And he said, 'O man greatly beloved, FEAR NOT, PEACE BE WITH YOU; BE STRONG AND OF GOOD COURAGE.' And when he spoke to me, I WAS STRENGTHED and said, 'Let my lord speak, FOR YOU HAVE STRENGTHENED ME</U></B>.'" Daniel 10:4-19</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The foregoing shows that Daniel wasn't terrified because he thought he was possessed by a demon, or because the angel squeezed him violently. In fact, instead of physically harming Daniel the angel relieved him of his fears and provided him with the strength he needed to endure the revelations.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Hence, unlike Muhammad's angel, this messenger didn't cause Daniel to tremble in fear or to run back to his companions shivering with dread and terror. Nor did this righteous angel cause Daniel to believe that he was possessed and cause him to contemplate suicide as a result.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>In Muhammad's case the spirit didn't even console or comfort him. Muhammad's wife was the one who actually calmed him down and tried to convince him that he wasn't possessed!</FONT></P>

If I wanted to be the Muslim personification of Shamoun I would go ahead and argue that this angel "tortured" Daniel by taking away his strength and almost suffocating him to death because he could "hardly breathe" (verse 17)</SPAN></FONT></H3>
<H3 style="MARGIN: auto 0in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><FONT face="Times New Roman">The only difference between this story in Daniel and Muhammad's (peace be upon him) experience is that angel Gabriel waited a little bit longer to soothe and calm Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) down.

<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN style="COLOR: windowtext"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Secondly, Shamoun is arguing from silence. He thinks that just because his Bible does not mention these experiences then that necessarily implies that they didn't happen.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Second, my point was that the Q. 29:48 could not be referring to anything other than a revealed Scripture in light of the context. Note, once again, what I initially wrote:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The problem with this proposed explanation is that that is not the plain reading of the text. The verse is not denying that Muhammad could read or write, but denying that Muhammad had read or written down an inspired Scripture prior to his receiving the Quran. In other words, the passage is simply saying that people couldn't accuse Muhammad of making up the Quran by plagiarizing information that he had received from some holy book which he had read or wrote down, such as the Jewish and Christian Scriptures, since this Quran is the first so-called holy book that he has ever read and/or written.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Now let me provide some additional context from the text itself in order to substantiate my point:</FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Dispute not with <B><I>the People of the Book</I></B> save in the fairer manner, except for those of them that do wrong; and say, 'We believe in what has been sent down to us, and what has been sent down to you; our God and your God is One, and to Him we have surrendered.' Even so <B><I>We have sent down to thee the Book</I></B>. Those to whom <B><I>We have given the Book</I></B> believe in it; and some of these believe in it; and none denies Our signs but the unbelievers. Not before this didst thou recite <B><I>any Book</I></B>, or inscribe it with thy right hand, for then those who follow falsehood would have doubted. Nay; rather it is signs, clear signs in the breasts of those who have been given knowledge; and none denies Our signs but the evildoers. They say, 'Why have signs not been sent down upon him from his Lord?' Say: 'The signs are only with God, and I am only a plain warner. What, is it not sufficient for them that <B><I>We have sent down upon thee the Book</I></B> that is recited to them? Surely in that is a mercy, and a reminder to a people who believe. S. 29:46-51</FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The immediate context refers to the People of the Book, to the revelation that Allah sent down to the Muslims, Jews and Christians, and to those to whom the Book was given. It is therefore obvious that the objection which the Quran is raising is that Muhammad could not have concocted or plagiarized stories from the former Scriptures and wrote them in the Quran since he had never read any of the previously revealed Books nor transcribed any of them with his own hands. </FONT></P>
