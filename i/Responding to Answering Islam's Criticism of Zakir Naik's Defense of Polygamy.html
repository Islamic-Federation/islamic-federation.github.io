<dir><font color="#006600"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Q. Why is a man allowed to marry more than one wife in Islam? Or why is polygamy allowed in Islam? </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Answer: </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">1. Definition of Polygamy </font></p>
</font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Polygamy means a system of marriage whereby one person has more than one spouse. Polygamy can be of two types. One is polygyny where a man marries more than one woman, and the other is polyandry, where a woman marries more than one man. In Islam, limited polygyny is permitted and polyandry is completely prohibited. Now coming to the original question, why is a man allowed to have more than one wife?</font></font></p>
</dir>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I accept Dr. Naik's definitions. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<dir><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#006600">2. Qur'an is the only religious scripture in the world that says "marry only one" Qur'an is the only religious book, on the face of this earth, that contains the phrase 'marry only one'. There is no other religious book that instructs men to have only one wife. In none of the religious scriptures like the Vedas, the Ramayan, the Mahabharat, the Geeta or the Bible does one find a restriction on the number of wives. According to these scriptures one can marry as many as one wishes.</font> </font></font></dir>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This is an argument of semantic irrelevance. In spite of Naik's attempt to put the Bible in a semantic straight-jacket, the Scriptures are very clear that monogamy was God's plan for mankind. In the first book of the Bible we read: </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<dir><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his <b>wife</b>, and they will become <b>one</b> flesh. <i>(Genesis 2:24)</i> </font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Has not [the LORD] made them <b>one</b>? In flesh and spirit they are his. And why <b>one</b>? Because he was seeking godly offspring. So guard yourself in your spirit, and do not break faith with the <b>wife</b> of your youth. <i>(Malachi 2:15)</i></font></font></p>
</dir>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Jesus said: </font></p>
<dir><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">"Haven't you read," he replied, "that at the beginning the Creator 'made them male and female,' and said, 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, <b>and the two</b> will become <b>one flesh</b>'? <b>So they are no longer two, but one</b>. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate." <i>(Matthew 19:4-6 )</i> </font></dir>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<dir><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#006600">It was only later, that the Hindu priests and the Christian Church restricted the number of wives to one.</font> </font></font></dir>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">How could the Christian Church restrict the number of wives to one when the first book of the Bible spells out God's plan of monogamy? I also wonder what significance Hindu marriage customs have on this discussion. Why does Naik use the beliefs and practices of another religion, which he considers false, to support his belief in Islam - which he considers to the be truth? </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="5"><b><u>My Response:</u></b> </font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">No where in any of the verses cited do we see any teachings on polygamy. The verses just simply say that when a man and woman get married they become one in flesh and spirit. So why can't a man become one in flesh and spirit with more than one woman? Why can't he become ONE with each one of them? Christians only misinterpret those verses to mean what they want, they don't prohibit polygamy at all. No where does the Bible prohibit polygamy, see this detailed </font><a href="http://www.answering-christianity.com/ntpoly.htm"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">article</font></a><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.</font></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="5"><b><u>Answering Islam said:</u></b> </font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<dir><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#006600">Many Hindu religious personalities, according to their scriptures, had multiple wives. King Dashrat, the father of Rama, had more than one wife. Krishna had several wives.</font> </font></font></dir>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Naik misunderstands his ancestors' religion. Dasharat married three women in order to produce a male heir. He had a daughter but he wanted a son (or sons) to assume his royal responsibilities. Kausalya did not produce a son, so he married Sumitra, who also failed to produce a son, and then married Kaikeyi. In spite of Dasharat, polygyny is not a universal practice in Hinduism or in Hindu mythology. Rama, Lakshmana, Bharatha and Shatrughna were all monogamous. Krishna had many wives because the women desired to marry him. Hinduism also mentions polyandry in the case of Draupadi, who had five husbands. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Once again, I must ask Dr. Naik why he appeals to Hindu mythology in order to defend his Islamic beliefs? Do the legends of Hinduism somehow validate Islam? Why does Dr. Naik appeal to the practices of unbelievers in order to justify his religion? </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="5"><b><u>My Response:</u></b> </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#000000">Well the point is (irrelevant of the reason) polygamy was allowed.</font> </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#000000">Because it is ironic that people criticize Islam because it permits polygamy and their own religion permits it as well. That is what Naik is trying to point out. So if your attacking Islam because it permits polygamy then your basically attacking your own religion. He is just exposing the hypocrisy and illogical criticisms of certain people.&nbsp;</font> </font></font></p>

<dir><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#006600">In earlier times, Christian men were permitted as many wives as they wished, since the Bible puts no restriction on the number of wives. It was only a couple of centuries ago that the Church restricted the number of wives to one.</font> </font></font></dir>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">No, Paul preached monogamy from the beginning of the Christian Church: </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<dir><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of <b>one wife</b>, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach; <i>(1 Timothy 3:2 )</i> </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well. <i>(1 Timothy 3:12)</i> </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly. <i>(Titus 1:6)</i> </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh." <i>(Ephesians 5 :31)</i></font></font></p>
<p><b><u><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My Response:</font></u></b></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Paul only restricted it to bishops, are all Christians bishops?</font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</dir>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="5"><b><u>Answering Islam said:</u></b> </font></font></p>
<dir><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#006600">Polygyny is permitted in Judaism. According to Talmudic law, Abraham had 2 wives, and Solomon had hundreds of wives.</font> </font></font></dir>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Naik gives us the story of Solomon - an excellent example of what happens when we refuse to follow God's plan, and follow our own desires: </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<dir><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray. As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father had been. (1 Kings 11:3-4) </font></dir>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">God is not compelled to honor a human institution which is contrary to His Divine Plan. Muhammad's polygamous lifestyle was hardly a picture of domestic bliss. There were rivalries between his wives and concubines and he once needed a "revelation" from God to restore peace in his house. For more information on this incident, read </font><a href="http://www.answeringislam.org/Quran/Tafsir/066.html"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Sex, Oaths, and the "Prophet" (Sura 66)</font></a><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">God made Adam and then created Eve as his companion. This was God's ideal model for the human race. God established marriage and He honors the union of one man and one woman. Whenever we deviate from God's Divine Plan (whether in polygyny, polyandry, adultery, pre-marital sex, or homosexuality) we can expect negative consequences in this life, as well as on the Day of Judgement. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="5"><b><u>My Response:</u></b> </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#000000">Solomon was not in any criticized for marrying more than one wife. However, his mistake was for marrying women from pagan families.</font> </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#000000">About the whole Surah 66 issue it had nothing to do with the Prophet having more than one wife. Everyone has problems with their wives. Are you trying to say that husband don't have problems with their wives in a monogamous marriage?</font> </font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">For the Surah 66 issue read this </font><a href="http://www.call-to-monotheism.com/rebuttal_to_ali_sina_s_article__mariyah_the_sex_slave_of_the_holy_prophet_"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">article</font></a><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.&nbsp;</font></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>

<dir><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#006600">The practice of polygyny continued till Rabbi Gershom ben Yehudah (960 A.D to 1030 A.D) issued an edict against it. The Jewish Sephardic communities living in Muslim countries continued the practice till as late as 1950, when an Act of the chief Rabbinate of Israel extended the ban on marrying more than one wife.</font> </font></font></dir>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rabbi Gershom ben Yehudah agreed with God's plan for humanity. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="5"><b><u>My Response:</u></b> </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#000000">First you have to show where God supposedly made that plan for humanity because it is no where to be found in your Bible. Secondly, this just goes to show that the prohibition of polygamy was from man and not from God.</font> </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="5"><b><u>Answering Islam said:</u></b> </font></font></p>
<dir><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#006600">3. Hindus are more polygamous than Muslims. The report of the 'Committee of The Status of Woman in Islam', published in 1975 mentions on page numbers 66,67 that the percentage of polygamous marriages between the year 1951-1961 was 5.06 among the Hindus and only 4.31 among the Muslims. According to Indian law only Muslim men are permitted to have more than one wife. It is illegal for any non-Muslim in India to have more than one wife. Despite it being illegal, Hindus have more multiple wives as compared to the Muslim. One can imagine what would have been the percentage of polygamous marriages among the Hindus if the Indian government had made it legal for them. Earlier, there was no restriction even on Hindu men with respect to the number of wives allowed. It was only in 1954, when the Hindu Marriage Act was passed that it became illegal for a Hindu to have more than one wife. At present it is the Indian Law that restricts a Hindu man from having more than one wife and not the Hindu scriptures.</font> </font></font></dir>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Once again, I am not sure why Dr. Naik appeals to Hinduism [as he considers Hinduism a false religion] in order to defend his faith. Why not cite the Mormons in the 19th century, or the many indigenous religions which also practice(d) polygamy? How do these belief systems, which Dr. Naik believes are false, "prove" the "truth" of Islam? Also, I have traveled across northern India twice during my lifetime and I have never encountered a Hindu with more than one wife. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="5"><b><u>My Response:</u></b> </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#000000">Because it is ironic that people criticize Islam because it permits polygamy and their own religion permits it as well. That is what brother Zakir Naik is trying to point out. So if your attacking Islam because it permits polygamy then your basically attacking your own religion. He is just exposing the hypocrisy and illogical criticisms of certain people.&nbsp;</font> </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="5"><b><u>Answering Islam said:</u></b> </font></font></p>
<dir><font color="#006600"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Let us now analyse why Islam allows a man to have more than one wife. </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">4. Qur'an permits limited polygyny As I mentioned earlier, Qur'an is the only religious book on the face of the earth that says "marry only one". The context of this phrase is the following verse from Surah Nisa of the Glorious Qur'an: "Marry woman of your choice in twos threes or fours" but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly, (with them), then only one" [Al-Qur'an 4:3] Before the Qur'an was revealed, there was no upper limit for polygyny and many men had scores of wives, some even hundreds. Islam put an upper limit of four wives. Islam gives a man permission to marry two, three or four women, only on the condition that he deals with them justly. In the same chapter i.e. Surah Nisa verse 129 says: "It is very difficult to be just and fair between women". [Al-Qur'an (4:129)]. Therefore polygyny is not a rule but an exception. Many people are under the misconception that it is compulsory for a Muslim man to marry more than one wife. Broadly, Islam has five categories of Do's and Dont's. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">(i) "Farz" i.e compulsory<br>
(ii) "Mustahab" i.e recommended or encouraged<br>
(iii) "Mubah" i.e permissible<br>
(iv) "Makruh" i.e "not recommended" or discouraged<br>
(v) "Haram" i.e prohibited or forbidden<br>
</font></p>
</font>
<p><font color="#006600"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Polygyny falls in the middle category of things that are permissible. It cannot be said that a Muslim who has two, three or four wives is a better Muslim as compared to a Muslim who has only one wife.</font></font></p>
</dir>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Why was Muhammad permitted more that 4 wives? </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="5"><b><u>My Response:</u></b> </font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Times New Roman">As for the Prophet's multiple marriages. The Prophet had privileges and limitations set by God for him. For example, the use of Miswak, Witr prayer and Qiyam Al Layl (prayer in two thirds of the night) were made obligatory on the Prophet but not on us Muslims. Similarly, the marrying up to 4 wives were made obligatory on us Muslims but not on the Prophet.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Times New Roman">But you have to realize that with this privilege came a limitation for the Prophet...</font></p>

<p><font color="#006600"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">India is one of the few countries, along with the other neighbouring countries, in which the female population is less than the male population. The reason lies in the high rate of female infanticide in India, and the fact that more than one million female foetuses are aborted every year in this country, after they are identified as females. If this evil practice is stopped, then India too will have more females as compared to males.</font></font></p>

When Dr Zakir Naik said "public property" he meant that she would go and sleep around with a bunch of men who would use her for sexual pleasure.

So if a woman is public property then men just go around sleeping with her.&nbsp;</font> </font></font></p>

<dir><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#006600">Biologically, it is not possible for an average man or a woman to remain celibate throughout life. It may be possible in exceptional cases of one in ten thousand. In the vast majority, the person either gets married or performs illicit sex or indulges in other sexual perversions.

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The human sex drive does not justify polygyny nor does it justify any other sexual perversions. God gave us a sex drive, however, God also gave us a model, in the form of marriage, where we are to channel these drives. Whenever we deviate from God's plans, whether in the form of polygyny or other perversions, we can expect to pay the consequences of our actions. The Bible tells: </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#000000">The main argument that Zakir Naik put forth for polygamy was not even properly addressed by the author! What solutions does Christianity give to this rising problem of there being more women available for marriage than men? Even the verse you quoted says that if you cannot control yourself then you should get married. However, what if there are not enough men to get married to for a monogamous marriage? The only solution is either for a woman to marry a married man or to go and commit fornication. Your Bible gives no solutions to this problem.&nbsp;</font> </font></font></p>

<dir><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#006600">In Western society it is common for a man to have mistresses and/or multiple extra-marital affairs, in which case, the woman leads a disgraceful, unprotected life. The same society, however, cannot accept a man having more than one wife, in which women retain their honourable, dignified position in society and lead a protected life. Thus the only two options before a woman who cannot find a husband is to marry a married man or to become public property. Islam prefers giving women the honourable position by permitting the first option and disallowing the second. There are several other reasons, why Islam has permitted limited polygyny, but it is mainly to protect the modesty of women.</font> </font></font></dir>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">How does Dr. Naik know that it is "common" for men to have extra-marital affairs - what are his data sources? Dr. Naik also ignores the fact that women have affairs as well! After all, a man cannot have an affair by himself! He also ignores the possibility that men with multiple wives might have affairs; and, once again, makes the disgusting reference to women as "property". </font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Some people find it unfair that a husband gets to have more than one wife while a wife could not have the same right. However, we have to understand that this is one of the tests for women here on earth. The woman who pleases her husband has such great honor that it could lead her straight to paradise. For a Muslim man to achieve that he would have to die a martyr! So just imagine how much easier it is for the woman to do so in order to attain paradise. If she is in a polygamous marriage it would actually be easier for her because she has other women helping her in pleasing her husband. Only if women truly understood this they would all want to be in a polygamous marriage. Earning paradise is not easy and requires the woman to be patient. This is her test in life. Just look at the magnificent awards that an obedient and pleasing wife could get out of something that she should be happy doing anyways...</font></p>

<p><font color="#006600"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">1. If a man marries more than one wife, the parents of the children born of such marriages can easily be identified. The father as well as the mother can easily be identified. In case of a woman marrying more than one husband, only the mother of the children born of such marriages will be identified and not the father. Islam gives tremendous importance to the identification of both parents, mother and father. Psychologists tell us that children who do not know their parents, especially their father undergo severe mental trauma and disturbances. Often they have an unhappy childhood. It is for this reason that the children of prostitutes do not have a healthy childhood. If a child born of such wedlock is admitted in school, and when the mother is asked the name of the father, she would have to give two or more names! I am aware that recent advances in science have made it possible for both the mother and father to be identified with the help of genetic testing. Thus this point was applicable for the past, and may not be applicable for the present.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Times New Roman">Well men are more sexually active than women. It would not be possible for a woman to sexually gratify more than husband. She also has her period in which men are prohibited to have sex with their wives. She can't go and do all the chores for each husband such as cleaning the house, cooking for them, watching after their kids etc. Men are physically stronger and more capable of handling more than one woman.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="5"><b><u>Answering Islam said:</u></b> </font></font></p>
<dir><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#006600">4. A woman who has more than one husband will have several sexual partners at the same time and has a high chance of acquiring venereal or sexually transmitted diseases which can also be transmitted back to her husband even if all of them have no extra-marital sex. This is less likely in a man having more than one sexual partner, and none of them having extra-marital sex. The above reasons are those that one can easily identify. There are probably many more reasons why Allah, in His Infinite Wisdom, has prohibited polyandry.</font> </font></font></dir>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This makes no sense at all. If these people lived in this arrangement with no extra-marital relations, by what vector would venereal diseases be transmitted? How would any veneral disease enter this group with no sexual relations to outside partners? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In conclusion, monogamy is God's plan for humanity. When we deviate from God's plan, we suffer. Pointing to the practices of other polygamous societies does not provide a defense for the practice of polygamy in Islam. Justifying the sin of polygyny, as a remedy for the sins of adultery, homosexuality, and fornication is absurd</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Times New Roman">In conclusion you proved absolutely nothing. Your criticizing something that your own religion permits.</font></p>
