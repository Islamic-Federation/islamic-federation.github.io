<p><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It's quite common for Christian apologists to be inconsistent in their methodology as well.</font></span></p>

<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><u><span lang="EN-GB" style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><font face="Times New Roman">My Response:</font></span></u></b></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Wood is generalizing here. He also fails to provide evidence: <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">which</span> Muslim apologist has argued in the above style? Which Muslim apologist has acknowledged the presence of &quot;textual&quot; variants within the Quran and then reasoned that &quot;textual variants aren't important&quot;? Who has done this?</font></span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Bible <b>DOES</b> contain textual variants and some of them happen to be very important for exegetical reasons. With regard to the Quran, Muslims do accept the presence of variant readings, but these are <b>NOT</b> textual variants which come about as a result of scribal activity, whether intentional or unintentional. Instead, these are <b><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">REVEALED</span></b> variant readings. The Muslim position is that these readings are all revealed by God and that the differences between the readings are also revealed and is of equal authority (read more about this issue </font><a href="http://www.call-to-monotheism.com/qur_anic_variants"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#3333ff" size="3">here</font></a><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> and </font><a href="http://www.call-to-monotheism.com/sam_shamoun_s_inconsistency__obfuscation_and_red_herrings__a_commentary_on_sam_shamoun_s__shabir_ally_s_inconsistency_of_criteria"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">here</font></a><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">). We acknowledge these REVEALED variants as we believe that the Quran was sent down in MULTIPLE READINGS. This is <b>VERY DIFFERENT</b> from the <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">TEXTUAL</span> variants we find in Biblical manuscripts, which rapidly propagated as manuscripts were copied and recopied. So Christian apologists such as Wood either innocently fail to comprehend the Muslim position or deliberately distort it in order to set up a straw man.</font></span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">To be precise, scribes copying the Quran also made errors are mistakes. They sometimes made spelling mistakes; sometimes they missed copying a line or twice copied a line/word. Such unintentional scribal errors do exist among the manuscripts of the Quran. But, <b>UNLIKE</b> the New Testament manuscript tradition, for example, Quranic scribes are not known to have deliberately altered manuscripts for theological reasons. They are not known to have intentionally altered a passage. The unintentional scribal errors which do exist did not rapidly propagate on to other manuscripts during the recopying stage due to the existence of the parallel oral transmission and they do not cause doubt over the integrity of the Quranic text. By all accounts the Quranic manuscript tradition is far more uniform than the Biblical manuscript tradition.</font></span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&quot;Muslims will point to the Gospels and say, &quot;Ha! Mark was written more than two decades after the life of Jesus! How can you trust such a late book?&quot; Then these same Muslims will quote Sahih al-Bukhari as a trustworthy source on the life of Muhammad--despite the fact that it was written more than two centuries after Muhammad's life.&quot;</font></span></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><u><span lang="EN-GB" style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><font face="Times New Roman">My Response:</font></span></u></b></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This is the wrong comparison. First, it is not &quot;Muslims&quot; who, out of nowhere, suddenly began to proclaim that Mark was written more than two decades after Jesus. This is the position adopted by ALL New Testament scholars. Mark is generally placed around the 60-70 AD period, which means it came about some thirty to forty years after Jesus. Certainly, this by itself does nothing to invalidate Mark's historicity. However, more importantly,&nbsp;with the exception of&nbsp;fundamentalists, almost all CHRISTIAN SCHOLARS believe that the canonical gospels cannot be taken as inerrant sources on the life of the historical Jesus. Compare the gospels and you will find many differences (as well as similarities) between the stories common between them. This suggests that the stories about Jesus were being changed prior to the composition of these gospels. There were minor changes as well as major changes. As a result, we cannot just extract anything from the gospels and presume it to be historically accurate or as reporting the literal wording of Jesus. In the words of Christopher Tuckett:</font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><b><span lang="EN-GB" style="COLOR: navy">Nevertheless the nature of the Gospel tradition means that we cannot simply take everything recorded in all the Gospels as unquestionably genuine reports about what Jesus said or did in a pre-Easter situation.</span></b><span lang="EN-GB"> <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">(Christopher M. Tuckett, <em>Christology and the New Testament: Jesus and His Earliest Followers</em>, 2001, Westminster John Knox Press, p. 203.)</b></span></font></font></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Moving on to Bukhari, even though this compilation itself came about some two centuries after Muhammed (peace be upon him), <b><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">it contains much earlier material within it</span></b>. Wood makes the mistake of thinking that the material within Bukhari's hadith collection was constructed or made up by him for the very first time. This is incorrect. Bukhari merely <b><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">COLLECTED</span></b> hadiths which had <b>ALREADY</b> been circulating <b><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">MUCH BEFORE</span></b> his time. He did not &quot;make them up&quot; (read more </font><a href="http://www.call-to-monotheism.com/refuting_the_argument_that_the_hadith_have_been_collected_200_years_after_the_death_of_the_prophet_and_therefore_are_unreliable_"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">here</font></a><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">)</font></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">While Muslims do accept the authenticity of the hadiths within Bukhari, they do not regard the collection to be inerrant. Thus we should continue to critically examine the hadiths and strive to improve and further the work carried out by earlier scholars. </font></span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&quot;But I want to focus on one particular conspiracy theory--the theory that Paul invented Christianity. In his debate with James White, Nadir Ahmed used this theory to rule out all the relevant evidence. Nadir claimed, without offering anything even remotely resembling a careful argument, that Paul had corrupted Jesus' message. Since the writings of the New Testament come after Paul, none of them can be used as evidence concerning Jesus' teachings. Moreover, since even the early church fathers were writing after Paul, their views don't count either.&quot;</font></span></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><u><span lang="EN-GB" style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><font face="Times New Roman">My Response:</font></span></u></b></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Paul certainly did not single handedly &quot;invent&quot; Christianity, although his ideas became dominant at a later time. This is not a conspiratorial position. That the gospels come to the scene after Paul and could have been influenced by some of his teachings is also not conspiratorial but commonsense. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">If not the inventor of Christianity, did Paul distort Jesus' message? The answer is both 'yes' and 'no'. That is because there are both continuities and discontinuities between Jesus and Paul. For now focusing only upon the discontinuities, Paul contradicts Jesus on his stance on the validity/keeping of the Jewish law, practise of circumcision and the food laws. Moreover, Paul believed Jesus to have been a divine pre-existent being. Numerous studies on the historical Jesus subject, however, have shown that it is highly unlikely that the historical Jesus viewed himself as a divine being, let alone the second person of the Trinity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For example, Catherine M.

<br />
The gospel of John presents Jesus teaching that he's divine, <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">but most scholars treat this as a later interpretation rather than a historical fact</b> because it's so much more highly developed here than in the earlier gospels and gospel sources ...</span><span lang="EN-GB"> <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">(Catherine M.

<p><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Likewise, Paul's view of salvation cannot be found in the teachings of the historical Jesus. </font></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">To say that Paul 100% reproduced the message of Jesus is to push it a bit too far, however for one to say that Paul did not at all is to push it a bit too far as well.</font></span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&quot;I claim that Muhammad was a Christian. He believed in Jesus' death, resurrection, and deity. The vast majority of &quot;Christians&quot; in <st1:place w:st="on">Arabia</st1:place> before the time of Muhammad were heretics. Hence, Muhammad came to restore true belief in Jesus Christ. He spent his entire life preaching the Gospel and turning people to faith in Jesus Christ. Many pagans were converted to Christianity under the powerful preaching of Muhammad and his disciples Abu Bakr and Umar. Muhammad gave his followers the Qur'an, which, in its original form, was simply an Arabic translation of the New Testament.</font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">But there was an evil pagan named Uthman, who hated Christianity, didn't know Muhammad, and worshiped Allah, one of the many gods of <st1:place w:st="on">Arabia</st1:place>. In order to destroy the work of Muhammad, Uthman pretended to be a faithful Christian. His deception was so convincing that he eventually rose to a position of leadership in the Christian community. Once he was in charge, Uthman asked all of the Christians in <st1:place w:st="on">Arabia</st1:place> for their copies of the Qur'an (i.e. their copies of the Arabic New Testament). Uthman then rewrote the entire Qur'an, turning it into a book which denies the core teachings of Christianity. He took all copies of the true Qur'an and burned them, and he used his power to silence his enemies.</font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Thus, the Islam of today is not the religion that Muhammad preached. Muhammad preached submission to Jesus Christ. Uthman corrupted this message by claiming that Allah is the only true God and that Jesus was a mere prophet of Allah. He did this in order to degrade Jesus and to keep people from believing in Christianity, the religion of Muhammad.&quot;</font></span></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><u><span lang="EN-GB" style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><font face="Times New Roman">My Response:</font></span></u></b></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Reminder to the readers: Wood is not saying that the above <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">really</span> happened. He is not arguing that the above is historical. So there is no reason for us to spend time refuting this theory.</font></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">However, Wood has not given examples of &quot;Muslims&quot; who have mounted a similar sort of conspiracy theory to debunk Christianity. The closest Wood came to it was his mention of these arguments which he claims are often raised by a number of Muslims against Christianity: <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">1.</b> Paul invented Christianity; <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">2.</b> There was a conspiracy at the Council of Nicaea; <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">3.</b> They wrote the Gospels themselves. Now none of these (with the exception of #3, an argument NOT made by &quot;many&quot; Muslims to begin with) are similar to the type of colossal conspiracy theory proposed by Wood above. Moreover, there are also many Muslims who do not make such arguments against Christianity (to name a few, Jerald Dirks, M. Azami, Timothy Winter, Lawrence Brown).</font></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">There aren't likely to be that many Muslims who have argued against Christianity in the way Wood has presented his conspiracy argument above.</font></span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&quot;Now for the fun part. How can Muslims refute my theory?&quot;</font></span></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><u><span lang="EN-GB" style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><font face="Times New Roman">My Response:</font></span></u></b></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">They do not need to refute the theory as long as it is just that: a theory/hypothesis. Unless, of course, Wood cares to submit some evidence to back up his claims.</font></span></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><u><span lang="EN-GB" style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><font face="Times New Roman">David Wood said:</font></span></u></b></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&quot;They can't appeal to the Qur'an, since all copies of the Qur'an were written after Uthman corrupted them. But Muslims can't appeal to the Hadith, Sira literature, or commentaries either, since all of these were written after the time of Uthman. Muslims can't even say that Uthman was one of the companions, since I'm claiming that Uthman simply rewrote history to help his position. Isnad criticism is irrelevant, since later Isnad critics were under the influence of Uthman's false teachings.&quot;</font></span></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><u><span lang="EN-GB" style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><font face="Times New Roman">My Response:</font></span></u></b></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Wood will be the first one to agree that the above is indeed a conspiracy and an unfair/invalid method of argumentation. Secondly, Wood has yet to demonstrate that the above is how Muslims generally argue against Christianity. We agree that there are problems with a number of Muslim arguments (some briefly noted above), but we think it is not right to paint all Muslims with the same brush and to give the impression as if all argue against Christianity in precisely the above manner from page one to the last page. </font></span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&quot;I conclude that Muhammad preached Christianity and that Uthman was the true founder of what is now called &quot;Islam.&quot;</font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">My question to my Muslim friends is this: Do you really want to take the route of conspiracy theories?&quot;</font></span></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><u><span lang="EN-GB" style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><font face="Times New Roman">My Response:</font></span></u></b></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Certainly Muslims (and everyone else) shouldn't take the conspiracy route. But note the problems pointed out above. Christians such as Wood need to stop exaggerating, generalising and face the issues in a serious scholarly manner for a change. Consider the scholarly work on Paul carried out by top notch scholars such as James Dunn and E. P. Sanders. These are well respected mainstream New Testament scholars who have proposed no wild &quot;conspiracy&quot; in their arguments, which show how Paul agrees and disagrees with the historical Jesus' teachings. Muslims should take the works of these scholars seriously in their investigation of early Christianity and the New Testament. </font></span></p>
