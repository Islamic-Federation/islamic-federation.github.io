Madden is not a new fallacious concept introduced by contemporary Christian revisionists but has been prevalent since the emergence of Islam on world stage. For many centuries, the Christian historians and orientalists directly promulgated lies and fabrications about Islam in order to instil prejudice against the Muslims. And yet in the modern age, Christian fundamentalist historians still continue to carry the flag and propagate indirectly their revisionist theories regarding Islam. </font><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crisismagazine.com/april2002/cover.htm"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A summarised article</font></a><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> of Thomas F. Madden's book entitled <em>A Concise History of the Crusades</em> has been published attempting to debunk the old-aged &quot;misconceptions&quot; of the Crusades. He chronologically discusses the major events of the initial Crusade until the 5th Crusade. I will Insha'Allah (God-willing) address the deceptive methods riddled in his article. He writes:</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: purple">Christians in the eleventh century were not paranoid fanatics. Muslims really were gunning for them. While Muslims can be peaceful, Islam was born in war and grew the same way. From the time of Mohammed, the means of Muslim expansion was always the sword.</span><span style="COLOR: black"> &nbsp;</span></font></font></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Here, Thomas F. Madden asserts and attempts to justify that medieval Christians were defending themselves from the Muslim &quot;aggression&quot;. Furthermore, he also allegedly states that Islam was born in a war giving the reader the impression that the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the early Muslim community provoked the war between the Arab pagans and the Muslims. This is far from the truth. Prophet Muhammad peacefully proclaimed the Message of the One True God and gained many followers. These early Muslims consisted of sons and brothers of the richest men in Makkah and also included slaves and the poor. As a result of their firm belief in Allah (God in Arabic), they were subjected to persecution. The Quraish (Arab tribe) restricted the people from buying or selling anything to the Muslims. They imposed economic and social boycott on them. They even prohibited Makkans from entering into marriages with them. Since Makkah was the land of the trade, the early Muslims couldn't endure this hardship. Consequently, the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) send the Muslims to <st1:place w:st="on">Abyssinia</st1:place> where a just Christian king ruled. The Quraish soon discovered the place that they emigrated to and thus send one of their tribesmen to the court of Najashi in order to ask the king to hand over the Muslims. Ja'far, who was one of the Muslims, was permitted to refute the accusations of the Quraish. He said:</font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: maroon">&quot;O King of <st1:place w:st="on">Abyssinia</st1:place>! We worshipped idols in the past and let our lives be consumed by fun and sport. To inflict cruelty upon the weak and the poor was our pastime. We were wrapped in abysmal darkness when Muhammad (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)&quot; bin Abdullah was born among us. He led us to righteousness and instructed us to shun idolatry. He called us to Allah Almighty. He showed us to be merciful and told us to abstain from evil and shelter the weak and poor&quot;.</span><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></font></font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: maroon">&quot;O King, we were a people steeped in ignorance, worshipping idols, eating un-sacrificed carrion, committing abominations, and harming the weak without reason until Allah sent us a Messenger from out of our midst, one whose lineage we knew well. His veracity, worthiness of trust and his integrity was also known to us. He called us unto Allah, that we should testify to His Oneness and worship Him and renounce what we and our fathers had worshipped in the way of stones and idols; and he commanded us to speak truly, to fulfil our promises, to respect the ties of kinship and the rights of our neighbours, and to refrain from crimes and from bloodshed. So we worship Allah alone, setting naught beside Him, counting as forbidden what He hath forbidden and as licit what He hath allowed. Our people turned against us<strong>, and have persecuted us to make us forsake our religion and revert from the worship of Allah to the worship of idols</strong>.</span><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></font></font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: maroon">&quot;We believed him, but O King! these, who have come to arrest us are idol-worshippers. They worship idols of stone and wood, inflict barbarism upon the weak. <strong>These people have persecuted, pelted and injured our Prophet </strong>(Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)&quot;.</span><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></font></font></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The above quote indisputably proves that the early Muslims where rather peaceful servants of God who only promoted peace and only defended themselves from the pagan aggressions. Thomas F. Madden then further claims that the expansion of Islam was only achieved through the use of the sword. Not only was this myth prevalent in the Frankish Europe, but it is still prevalent in the present age in the minds of many Christians. The well known author, James Michener, writes:</font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: maroon">No other religion in history spread so rapidly as Islam. <strong>The West has widely believed that this surge of religion was made possible by the sword. But no modern scholar accepts this idea, and the Qur'an is explicit in the support of the freedom of conscience.</strong></span><span style="COLOR: black">[1]&nbsp;</span></font></font></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This misconception is also addressed by K. S. Ramakrishna Rao who writes:</font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: maroon">My problem to write this monograph is easier, because we are not generally fed now on that (distorted) kind of history and much time need not be spent on pointing out our misrepresentations of Islam. <strong>The theory of Islam and sword, for instance, is not heard now in any quarter worth the name. The principle of Islam that &quot;there is no compulsion in religion&quot; is well known.</strong></span><span style="COLOR: black">[2]&nbsp;</span></font></font></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">And Lawrence E. Browne who states:</font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: maroon">Incidentally these well-established facts dispose of the idea so <strong>widely fostered in Christian writings that the Muslims, wherever they went, forced people to accept Islam at the point of the sword.</strong></span><span style="COLOR: black">[3]</span><span style="COLOR: maroon">&nbsp;</span></font></font></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Professor Arnold Thomas addresses this widely-held belief in one of his books. He writes:</font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: maroon">To give any account of these campaigns is beyond the scope of the present work, but it is important to show that Muhammad, when he found himself at the head of a band of armed followers, <strong>was not transformed at once, as some would have us believe, from a peaceful preacher into a fanatic, sword in hand, forcing his religion on whomsoever he could.</strong></span><span style="COLOR: black">[4] &nbsp;</span></font></font></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity states:</font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: maroon">Christianity has largely misunderstood the nature of Islamic militancy<strong>. The fiction that Islam was preached by the sword and Christianity by the lamb and the dove appeared early in Christian writings and still exercises a powerful influence upon the popular perception of Islam. Christian polemicists were quick to contrast the idealized life of Christ with that of Muhammad and his followers, 'who ceased not to go forth in battle and rapine, to smite with the sword, to seize the little ones, and ravish wives and maidens'.</strong></span><span style="COLOR: black">[5]</span><span style="COLOR: maroon">&nbsp;</span></font></font></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">So in the light of the above mentioned evidence, was the mean of the Muslim expansion always the sword? Ira Zepp Jr, who is another Non-Muslim author, answers the aforementioned question:</font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: maroon">It is unfortunate that Islam has been stereotyped as the 'religion of the sword' or that Islam was 'spread by the sword.' <strong>The historical reality is that the expansion of Islam was usually by persuasion and not by military power. In any case, Islam cannot be forced on anyone; if profession of the shahadah [i.e. the declaration of Islam] is forced on someone, it is not true Islam.</strong></span><span style="COLOR: black">[6]&nbsp;</span></font></font></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Thomas F. Madden further writes:</font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: purple">But, in traditional Islam, Christian and Jewish states must be destroyed and their lands conquered. When Mohammed was waging war against <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mecca</st1:place></st1:city> in the seventh century, Christianity was the dominant religion of power and wealth. As the faith of the Roman Empire, it spanned the entire Mediterranean, including the <st1:place w:st="on">Middle East</st1:place>, where it was born. The Christian world, therefore, was a prime target for the earliest caliphs, and it would remain so for Muslim leaders for the next thousand years. </span><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></font></font></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Thomas here conceals the status of <st1:place w:st="on">Byzantine Empire</st1:place> and the corruption that was predominately during that period. The Muslims never introduced the expansion for the sake of grabbing lands but they conquered the other nations so that they could free the oppressed inhabitants of the <st1:place w:st="on">Byzantine Empire</st1:place> and exterminate the ignorance and promote free-thinking. And once they conquered these nations, they never imposed their beliefs on the inhabitants since it contradicts the principle of Islam that there is no compulsion in religion. Edward Gibbon who is regarded by many as the best contemporary historian comments on the Islamic expansion by describing it as: &nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: maroon">one of the most memorable revolutions which has impressed a new and lasting character on the nations of the globe.</span><span style="COLOR: black">[7] &nbsp;</span></font></font></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Dr. Lebon stated: </font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: maroon">&quot;The early Muslim conquests might have blurred their common sense and made them commit the sorts of oppression which conquerors usually commit, and thus ill-treat the subdued and compel them to embrace the Faith they wanted to spread all over the globe. Had they done so, all nations, which were still not under their control, might have turned against them, and they might have suffered what had befallen the Crusaders in their conquest of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Syria</st1:place></st1:country-region> lately. However, the early Caliphs, who enjoyed a rare ingenuity which was unavailable to the propagandists of new faiths, realized that laws and religion cannot be imposed by force. Hence they were remarkably kind in the way they treated the peoples ofSyria, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region>, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Spain</st1:country-region></st1:place> and every other country they subdued, leaving them to practise their laws and regulations and beliefs and imposing only a small Jizya in return for their protection and keeping peace among them. In truth, nations have never known merciful and tolerant conquerors like the Muslims.&quot;</span><span style="COLOR: black">[8] &nbsp;</span></font></font></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">He further adds,</font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><strong><span style="COLOR: maroon">&quot;The mercy and tolerance of the conquerors were among the reasons for the spread of their conquests and for the nations' adoptions of their Faith and regulations and language</span></strong><span style="COLOR: maroon">, which became deeply rooted, resisted all sorts of attack and remained even after the disappearance of the Arabs' control on the world stage, though historians deny the fact. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region> is the most evident proof of this. It adopted what the Arabs had brought over, and reserved it. Conquerors before the Arabs -- the Persians, Greeks and Byzantines -- could not overthrow the ancient Pharaoh civilization and impose what they had brought instead.</span><span style="COLOR: black">[9] &nbsp;</span></font></font></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This is also evidently in the statement of Count de Castri. He writes: </font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: maroon">&quot;The spread of Islam and the submission to its authority seem to have another reason in the continents of Asia and <st1:place w:st="on">North Africa</st1:place>. <strong>It was the despotism of <st1:place w:st="on">Constantinople</st1:place> which exercised extreme tyranny, and the injustice of rulers was too much for people to bear...</strong></span><span style="COLOR: black">[10]&nbsp;</span></font></font></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">So thus, it was due the abundance of good in medieval Christendom that opened the doors of Islamic Expansion. This also resulted to a mass conversion to Islam under no coercion </font></span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Professors Thomas Arnold again comments that:</font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: maroon">&quot;This misinterpretation of the Muslim wars of conquest has arisen from the assumption that wars waged for the extension of Muslim domination over the lands of the unbelievers implied that the aim in view was their conversion.&quot;</span><span style="COLOR: black">[11]&nbsp;</span></font></font></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">One example to note is the conquest of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Spain</st1:place></st1:country-region>. In 711 CE, an oppressed Christian chief named Julian went to Musa ibn Nusair, the governor of North Africa, with a plea for help against the tyrannical Christian Visigoth ruler of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Spain</st1:place></st1:country-region>, Roderick. Musa responded by sending the young general Tariq bin Ziyad with an army of 7000 troops, burned their fleets, and defeated the 30,000 Visigoths. One of his remarkable speech was after burning his fleet -- &quot;The sea is behind you, and the enemy is ahead of you, and you have no escape but the truth and patience.&quot; A new atmosphere of toleration began for the Jews. The Muslims had few men and needed help in every city they conquered to maintain their rule. The Jews helped the Muslims because they represented an opportunity to free themselves from the Visigoths. The Christians and Jews were liberated in Al-Andalusia. The Syrians welcomed the Muslims as their liberators since they liberated from their religious trouble and also relieved them of the burdensome taxes that that were placed on their backs. They praised the Muslims by announcing publically, <em>&quot;Praise be to God, who delivered us from the unjust Byzantines and put us under the rule of the Muslims&quot;.</em> A great amount of them converted to the Islamic faith. This liberation goes in accordance with the Quranic verse:</font></span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: blue">And why should you not fight in the cause of Allah and of those who, being weak, are ill-treated (and oppressed)? Men, women, and children, whose cry is: 'Our Lord! Rescue us from this town, whose people are oppressors; and raise for us from Yourside one who will protect; and raise for us from Your side one who will help!')</span><span style="COLOR: black"> <em>(An-Nisaa' 4:75).</em></span></font></font></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt; TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><strong><span style="COLOR: black">The First Crusade</span></strong></font></font></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The First Crusade was launched by Pope Urban II by announcing that Muslim forces were taking over Christian nations. He further prepared the Christians to bring back the lands under the Christian by retaliate a Crusade against the Muslims. The Pope attempted to deceive the masses that they were fighting for a good cause but only a handful responded to his call whilst joined the ranks to pillage and plunder, or to escape their feudal lords. Professor of History, Joel T. Rosenthal, contributed an article at Encarta Encyclopaedia stating:</font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: maroon">They knew little about the <st1:place w:st="on">Byzantine Empire</st1:place> or its religion, Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Few Crusaders understood or had much sympathy for the Eastern Orthodox religion, which did not recognize the pope, used the Greek language rather than Latin, and had very different forms of art and architecture.

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Seljuk Muslims saved the whole Islamic domains from total extinction in regard to the wholesale slaughter propagated by the crusaders of populations in Maarat Al-Numan, <st1:city w:st="on">Antioch</st1:city> and <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:place></st1:city>.

They were coercively, and insincerely, converted to Christianity. It does not come as a suprise since Christianity gained most of its followers through forced conversions. <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Compton</st1:place></st1:city>'s Concise Encyclopaedia states: &nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: maroon">This was a quasi-ecclesiastical tribunal established in 1478 by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella primarily to examine converted Jews, and later converted Muslims, and punish those who were insincere in the conversion.... The Spanish Inquisition was much harsher than the medieval Inquisition and the death penalty was more often exacted, sometimes in mass autos-da-fe. It judged cases of bigamy, seduction, usury, and other crimes, and was active in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Spain</st1:place></st1:country-region> and her colonies. Estimates of its victims vary widely, ranging from less than 4,000 to more than 30,000 during its existence...</span><span style="COLOR: black">[26] &nbsp;</span></font></font></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Encyclopaedia Britannica, states: &nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: maroon">The Inquisition's secret procedures, its eagerness to accept denunciations, its use of torture, the absence of counsel for the accused, the lack of any right to confront hostile witnesses, and the practice of confiscating the property of those who were condemned and sharing it between the Inquisition, the crown, and the accusers - all this inspired great terror, as indeed it was meant to do.</span><span style="COLOR: black">[27] &nbsp;</span></font></font></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The only sole reason why the Muslims surrendered peacefully was due the fact that the Christian officials made a binding treaty with the Muslims which is also known as the 'treaty of 1492'. In that treaty, the Christian officials promised religious tolerance to the Muslims and the Jews. It was an attempt to win religious tolerance for all the Muslims and Jews left in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Spain</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Since the Muslims were no longer the rulers of <st1:place w:st="on">Andalusia</st1:place>, they hoped at least that they would be permitted to worship their Lord, The One God, in the manner presented by the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). However, in 1499 CE, Ximenes initiated a campaign to coerce the Muslims of Southern Muslim Spain to Christianity. P. de Gayangos writes:</font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: maroon">As a result of his endeavours, it is reported that on 8th December 1499 about three thousand Moors were baptized by him and a leading mosque in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Granada</st1:place></st1:city> was converted into a church. 'Converts' were encouraged to surrender their Islamic books, several thousands of which were destroyed by Ximenes in a public bonfire. A few rare books on medicine were kept aside for the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placetype w:st="on">University</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename w:st="on">Alcala.</st1:placename></st1:place></span><span style="COLOR: black">[28] &nbsp;</span></font></font></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Muslims were dragged through the streets of the Muslim quarter for rejecting to adopt the Christian faith. Consequently, the Muslim initiated a riot protesting that the treaty was not honoured. P. de Gayangos further writes: &nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span style="COLOR: maroon">Ximenes immediately denounced the uprising as a rebellion, and claimed that by this the Moors had forfeited all their rights under the terms of capitulation. They should therefore be given the choice between baptism and expulsion. The government agreed with his arguments, and Ximenes then began the mass baptism of the population of <st1:city w:st="on">Granada</st1:city>, most of whom preferred this fate to the more hazardous one of deportation to <st1:place w:st="on">Africa</st1:place>. The speed with which the baptisms were carried out meant that there was no time in which to instruct the Moors in the fundamentals of their new religion, so that inevitably most of the new converts became Christian only in name.</span><span style="COLOR: black">[29] &nbsp;</span></font></font></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Additionally, it has been estimated that at least 50,000 Muslims were forced to convert in the mass baptism of <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Granada</st1:place></st1:city> by Ximenes. A small amount of Jews and Muslims were deported to North-Africa. The tolerance of the Muslims for the Jews never decreased, so they aided the Jews in the progress of the deportation. In spite of the circumstances, a new Golden Age flourished in North-Africa. In Andarax, mosques were blown up with gun-powder and at Belfique, all the Muslim men were put to the sword whilst the women were taken as slaves. The Muslim children were separated from their parents and handed over to the Church in order to be brought up as Catholics. The Arabic books including the Glorious Qur'an were collected and burnt. H.

Behind the words of conciliation and peace, the general intention of the Church to eliminate the practice of Islam was unmistakable, and now that the Muslims of southern Andalusia, or the Moriscos as they were called, were within the jurisdiction of the Spanish Inquisition, the Inquisitors embarked on the task of detecting 'relapsed heretics' and secret Muslims. The communities of Muslims which had survived the suppression of the rebellion, or reformed after it, were repeatedly harassed by the Inquisitors.</span><span style="COLOR: black">[30]</span></font></font></p>

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt"><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is quite clear that the nature of this article is based on wishful thinking rather than concrete evidence. A thorough analysis of every evidence pertained to the Crusades would conclude that the Crusades were a colonial venture motivated by greed, lack of opportunity in Frankish Europe and territorial expansion. Thomas attempts to justify the wholesale slaughter of millions of innocent people during the Crusades by basing his opinions on fictitious evidence. It is time for the Christian revisionist historians to step out of denial and acknowledge that Christians are not on a moral high ground. And Allah knows best! </font></span></p>
