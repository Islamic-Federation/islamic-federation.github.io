<p class="MsoTitle" style="MARGIN: 5pt 0.5in"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="COLOR: red"><span style="COLOR: black"><span style="COLOR: red">The first of the criticisms which are now commonly being directed against the Hadith is that they were not collected in the time of the Prophet or of the Khulafa&#39; al-Rashidun, and that during the period between the utterance or occurrence of their contents and their being recorded in writing there was every chance of their being materially altered. Some have even gone so far as to say that they were not recorded because they were unreliable. That in the earlier stages they were not fully recorded in writing, is true, though it is not true that they were not recorded at all even as regards the Prophet&#39;s lifetime, for there is good evidence to show that `Abdullah b. `Amr b. al-`As for one, used to write down what he heard from his Master. Other Companions too put their collections of Hadith into writing later in life, particularly Abu Hurayrah and `Abdullah b. `Abbas, two very important sources of Hadith. But in general it can be said that Hadiths were only partially and privately recorded in writing in the early stages.<br />
<br />
The reasons for this are quite clear and there is nothing mysterious about them. The Arabs&#39; antipathy to writing in this period is well-known, very few of were literate. Huge stores of knowledge of genealogy and poetry preserved in their prodigious memories; some people being able to recite a hundred thousand verses. There were no books in currency among them; even during the Prophet&#39;s lifetime the Qur&#39;an did not circulate in book form. The fact that the Prophet&#39;s sayings, legal decisions and deeds, were not generally written down is therefore not surprising in the least. There is also evidence that the Prophet disapproved of the general writing of Hadith in his lifetime for fear that they would become mixed up with the Qur&#39;an, which had not yet been fully revealed, and with which the Muslims had yet to become completely familiar. But this is not to say that he disapproved of memorising of, or acting upon Hadith; on the contrary, he insisted on it. The more learned of the Companions, including the Khulafa&#39; al-Rdshidun, spent their time in absorbing thoroughly the explanations, applications, and developments of the Qur&#39;an by the Prophet in addition to their study of the Qur&#39;an itself. When the Prophet had passed away from this world and the age of the Caliphs came, after some deliberation they also came to the conclusion that the written recording of Hadiths and publishing them in a book form was inexpedient at this stage, for the same reasons as in the Prophet&#39;s lifetime, that the Word of Allah must be learnt and studied and thoroughly absorbed first, while its practical application by the Prophet can be handed down by word of mouth and by personal example. But if we look at the life and the decisions of the Khulafa&#39; al-Rashidun, we find that in every case where any matter had not been dealt with explicitly by the Qur&#39;an, they considered it obligatory to discover what was the practice of the Prophet in this situation and made their decisions according to their findings. To contravene the practice of the Prophet on any vital matter was in their eyes equivalent to contravening Islam itself.<br />
<br />
The whole of the history of this period shows this valuation of the Prophet&#39;s practice, and on this point there is complete unanimity. It is a grave mis-statement to say that `Umar al-Khattab was against the relating of Traditions; he was only against collecting them into book form, not that they should not be learnt and known. He was certainly strict as regards accuracy of reporting and always demanded a supporting witness if any Companion recounted something of the Messenger of Allah; when that witness was forthcoming he accepted the Tradition with no further hesitation. In those cases which came up before him he continually had recourse to his own knowledge of the Prophet&#39;s rulings, and if he himself did not have this knowledge he appealed to the other Companions; on receiving the required information and after satisfying himself regarding its accuracy, he immediately acted upon it. Indeed, the fact that Hadiths were completely recorded in writing during the lifetime of the Companions was no drawback; they themselves were living models of his practice and treasure-houses of his sayings. They spread over the huge areas which now constituted the Islamic empire, to Kufah and Basrah in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Iraq</st1:country-region>, to <st1:country-region w:st="on">Syria</st1:country-region>, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Palestine</st1:city>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region></st1:place> and Khurasan. Here they were surrounded by eager pupils both Arab and non-Arab, thirsting to hear about their revered Prophet from those who had seen and lived with him. Some of these pupils, who are known as the Followers of the Companions (Tdbi `un), became renowned all over the Islamic world for their learning in the Qur&#39;an and the Sunnah, for their correct reporting and understanding of Hadith, and for their piety and purity of life. Such were Hasan Basri, the associate of the companions `Imran b. Husayn and Anas b. Malik in Basrah; Alqama and Aswad, the repositories of the vast learning of `Abdullah b. Mas&#39;jid in Kufah, who were also the pupils of `Umar and `A&#39;ishah; Said b. Musaiyib, the pupil of Abu Hurayrah and Taus, Mujahid, `Ata&#39; b. AM Rabah and others; Nafi`, the pupil of `A&#39;ishah, and many others whose honesty and trustworthiness are unquestioned. Here it is important to note that `A&#39;ishah and Abu Hurayrah lived up to between 50 and 60 A.H, `Abdullah b. `Abbas and `Abdullah b. `Umar to around 70 A.H., Abu Said Khudri to between 70 and 80 A.H. and Anas b. Malik to 90 A.H. This is to say that in the second half of the first century of the Hijrah it was still possible to hear a great store of Hadith from those who had seen or heard them directly from the Messenger of Allah himself.<br />
<br />
Nearly all the famous Tabi `un we have mentioned just now, lived up to dates between 90 and 120 A.H., which means up to this time the collections of Hadith related by these perfectly reliable reporters were available to all who wished to take them. Before the first quarter of the second century (100-125 A.H.) collections in book form were still not current, and although many Tabi`un had their private written collections, the main basis of teaching was verbal, as was the fashion during this era when knowledge even if written was always committed to memory. It was at this time that the first large-scale collections in book form began to be made, those by Ibn Jurayj, Malik, Sufyan Thawri, Ma&#39;mar b. Rashid and others, all pupils of the Tabi`un. The idea that much time elapsed between the original hearing and final recording in book form of Hadith as would make them unreliable is found to be completely unfounded when their history as given above is attentively considered, particularly with regard to these early collections, almost all the contents of which found their way into the later collections of al-Bukhari etc., a century later. But the principle is also established that those Hadiths recounted by the well-known and reliable Tabi`un whether collected into book form or not were available from the recounters themselves up to the first quarter of the second century of the Hijrah, and it only requires two or three successive trustworthy scholars of Hadith to convey them to al-Bukhari and his contemporaries. It is also necessary to mention that between the earliest published compilations and al-Bukhari&#39;s time there were other large classified collections of great importance such as that of `Abdur Razaq (died shortly after 200 A.H.), the pupil of Ibn Jurayj, Sufyan Thawri, Ma&#39;mar b. Rashid and Malik, the earlier collectors. The question arised as to what were these unreliable, wrong or concocted Hadith of which so much fuss is being made by ill-informed critics today?<br />
<br />
It is not true to state that untrustworthy traditions regarding the Messenger of Allah existed to any noteworthy extent during the main portion of the era of the Khulafa&#39; al-Rashidun. It was only when the Schismatics began to appear such as the Kharijis, and the dynastic clashes of the Banu Umayyah, Banu `Abbas and Band Hashim convulsed the Ummah, and particularly after the martyrdom of Imam Husayn and his family at <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Karbala</st1:place></st1:city>&#39;, that some partisans had recourse to distorting or inventing Hadith to justify their claims. But it was never the real scholars of traditions who related these incorrect reports, nor had they any purpose in doing so; unreliable Traditions were purveyed by unreliable people, the partisans, popular preachers, story-tellers and so on, and have not escaped the eagle eyes of the very critical Muhaddithun. The solid body of recognised Hadith which forms the basis of Muslim Law can be found in Malik as well as in the decisions of Abu Hanifah and the later Imams. If there are differences of opinion on any important point it is almost always where that difference already existed among the companions. What is remarkable about Muslim law based on the Qur&#39;an, and Sunnah as presented by Abu Hanifah and Malik, for instance, is not the differences in detail but the extraordinary agreement in its main structure, which proves that there was an agreed corpus of Sunnah which was common to both schools of thought. It is a common fallacy to speak of the accepted books of traditions such as al Bukhari, Muslim, al-Tirmidhi, etc., as if they themselves constitute the source of Islamic Fiqh. They are certainly adduced as authorities in later judicial controversy, but it is often forgotten that the whole fabric of Fiqh was erected before these traditionists were even born. Abu Hanifah himself was born in 80 A.H. when some of the other Companions of the Prophet were still alive, and he was the pupil of some of the famous Tabi`un we have mentioned above, particularly `Ata&#39; b. Abi Rabah in Makkah. The body of traditions used by Abu Hanifah and Malik were fresh from the Tabi`un and unsullied by partisan politics and imaginative interpolations, which in any case affected traditions treating with law very little. These traditions are present in the later collections, but were used by Abu Hanifah one hundred years earlier.<br />
<br />
The statement reported by the biographers of Imam al-Bukhari that he selected 7,000 Hadiths out of 600,000 is being put to much use by the detractors of Hadith to attempt to show that the majority are unreliable. This statement was made to extol his industry and discrimination, but from the point of view of the history of Hadith it is necessary to go more deeply into the matter and avoid rash conclusions which do not conform to reality. In citing this bare statement, the impression is given that in al-Bukhari&#39;s time there was a vast, unclassified mass of every kind of tradition, true and false, floating all over the then Islamic empire, and that he suddenly appeared on the scene, separated the true from the false, and was only able to find 7,000 out of 600,000. The real facts are nothing resembling this at all. Criticism and scrutiny of Hadith was being done from the very beginning, even in the time of the Companions and their Followers, and there had always been a central core of unquestionable true Hadith with the earnest, sincere and pious scholars. For instance, the comments of Muhammad b. Hasan, the renowned pupil of Abu Hanifah, on Malik&#39;s book of Hadith, the Muwatta&#39;, show that out of more than a thousand traditions of the Messenger of Allah and the Companions quoted by Malik, Abu Hanifah only differed with about eighty and even then not regarding their authenticity, but preferring a different ruling. The mischief of fabricating or distorting Hadith was begun, during the time of the political dissension between the Banu Hashim and the Umayyads, and particularly after the massacre of <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Karbala</st1:place></st1:city>&#39;, when unprecedented passions were roused. But these unreliable traditions circulated among the leading partisans of these two parties and were used to prospective supporters; the really learned were well aware of this and such dishonest tampering with the true Sunnah was clearly denounced by them, and the relaters of such traditions singled out and condemned.<br />
<br />
A study of the comments of traditionists on such fabricators and the rejection of their claims to credibility show this plainly, for instance, al-Sha&#39;bi, one of the leading Tabi`un in knowledge of tradition and law, roundly condemns various people who related much partisan reports attributing them wrongly to `Ali. This kind of fabrication had currency among the ignorant and those who had special<br />
interest, not among the scholars.<br />
<br />
A second breeding-ground for incorrect and exaggerated traditions were the public preachers and story-tellers, who are prone to this weakness to the present day. The books of the biographies of the reporters of traditions are full of condemnations of people of this type, and their effusions, though gaining currency among the unlettered, were never accepted by the learned. Apart from these two main sources of falsification, there were other unreliable Hadiths&nbsp; which were due to mere human weakness, such as forgetting, mixing-up,&nbsp; exaggeration, ascribing statements of the Companions to the Prophet himself and so on. The whole science of the traditionists was brought to bear on the elimination of such weak reports, and by an amazingly thorough system of analysis and comparison and minute checking, these defects have been brought to light and carefully classified.<br />
<br />
The immense research which has gone into the study of Hadith cannot be imagined by simply reading the bare translation of one of the well-known compilations. To know something of what the Muslim traditionists have achieved, one has to go through such comparative studies of Hadith such as `Asqalani&#39;s commentary on al Bukhari, where all the ramifications of the variants of a particular Hadith are traced meticulously. After making such a study the only honest conclusion one can reach is that it is difficult if not impossible to arrive at anything but the same conclusions as these great Muslim religious scholars. With regard to the statement regarding al Bukhari&#39;s selection of Hadith, it is also necessary to understand that in the language of traditionists, all the variants of a single Hadith are counted as a separate Hadith, or an identical Hadith related by two or more different persons. For instance, the famous Hadith reported by `Umar, &quot;actions are judged by intentions,&quot; is related from 700 different authorities. In the terminology of the traditionists, these are counted as 700 Hadiths. Thus the large number of Hadith mentioned are not actually all different, but contain many slight variations of a single Hadith.<br />
<br />
In sum, this statement regarding al-Bukhari&#39;s discrimination only amounts to say that he took the trouble to study the whole of the Hadiths, both reliable and unreliable, which existed written or unwritten in his day. But it should not be imagined that he was the first to determine the true from the false; a generally agreed body of good and fair traditions was already in existence with the earlier traditionists. Al-Bukhari added his own unparalleled acumen to make a final examination and compiled a definitive selection of those Hadiths which possessed the very best authority. Those who lightly challenge the authority of such compilations should be well aware of what they are doing; it requires a person of exceptional industry and intelligence even to reach to the level of a pupil of these great Muhaddithun. To surpass them would require something more than the superficial and biased minds of today, which have not shown themselves capable of any constructive work in the religious field up to the present.&nbsp;</span><b> (Shaykh Shahidullah Faridi, <em>Fallacies of Anti Hadith Argument</em>, <a href="http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=1846&amp;CATE=120">Source</a>)</b></span></span></font></font></p>

These scholars listed the mistakes made in both the isnaad (chain of narrators) and matn (texts) of&nbsp; reports; so you can see that for each narrator they made a list of the mistakes that he had made and the letters that he had mispronounced. If the mistakes of the narrators - in both the isnaad and the matn - did not go unchecked, then how could the fabricated ahaadeeth manufactured by the heretics have slipped past those brilliant scholars?&nbsp; How could people have narrated ahaadeeth from heretics without the scholars noticing?

<p align="justify" class="MsoTitle" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="COLOR: red">An assumption that has misled both the Qur&#39;an-only people and the traditionalists is that if the Hadith is revelatory, it must have been preserved just as the Qur&#39;an with complete reliability. From very early times some Qur&#39;an-only people have argued on the basis of this assumption, saying that since the Hadith is not preserved with complete reliability, it could not be revelatory. And from equally early times some traditionalists have argued on the basis of the same assumption that since the Hadith is revelatory it must have been preserved with complete reliability. The assumption prevents both parties to combine a respect for the Hadith, which is due to a sacred and revelatory tradition, with a critical approach to the question of its authenticity.<br />
<br />
If it looks strange to anyone that God should have sent a revelation without guaranteeing its completely faithful preservation for all times, then let them think of the hundreds, if not tens of thousands, of prophets sent before Islam. These earlier prophets all received revelations but alteration (<i>tahrif</i>) of a serious nature in the revelations during the process of transmission is a fact which is supported by the Qur&#39;an (2:75,79, 4:46, 5:13, 41) and is also established beyond doubt by critical historical research.. Indeed the revelations given to some prophets have completely vanished from history while those given to such prophets as Moses, Jesus and several other Israelite prophets exist in the form of traditions whose reliability is no greater than that of the Hadith. One may say that if for the earlier prophets the revelations were not fully preserved it is because they were not meant to guide humankind till the end of times whereas since the Prophet Muhammad was the last of the prophets sent to guide all humankind till the day of judgment the revelation given to him should be preserved with complete integrity. The flaw in this argument is that even if the earlier revelations were meant for a limited period, they should have been preserved, according to the assumption in question, at least for the period for which they were meant to guide. But this is far from being the case. The prophethood of Jesus lasted for about six centuries until the advent of the Prophet of Islam. Yet the message of the prophet Jesus was not preserved with complete integrity even for one century. Indeed, many of the books of the New Testament were written within fifty years of Jesus&#39; departure and already they have much more fabricated material than the historically reliable material. It is thus clear that God has a different way of working than we have rather naively assumed. What is this way of God?<br />
<br />
In view of the fact that revelations given to earlier prophets were not preserved with complete historical accuracy, we must of necessity conclude that that is not what God considers absolutely essential. The way he seems to lead human beings to development and growth is that through a prophet certain concerns are raised and some tantalizing answers to certain basic questions are given. Then people are left to try to understand the concerns that are raised and answers that are provided. In the process they develop spiritually and find the way to salvation. Of course, as human beings, they can corrupt the message given by the prophets to an extent that it more or less becomes ineffective, after which there is need for fresh revelation. Thus in the case of Jesus, even though the New Testament has considerably changed the message of Jesus it is to some extent still effective for guiding people and leading them to salvation (2:62, 5:69). But the Christians continued to change the revelation even after the New Testament was completed so much so that by the fourth century their mainstream tradition departed even from the central principle of <i>tawhid</i> preached by all the prophets, thus finally making the revelation brought by Jesus not only ineffective for salvation but a means of eternal damnation, except for a small fraction of Unitarian Christians (5:69-73). We can understand this by an analogy. Almost every glass of water has some impurities. Up to a certain level of impurities it is a life-giving drink while beyond that level it can become a source of sickness or even death.<br />
<br />
Before Jesus the case with the revelation brought by Moses was similar. It was preserved for a little while but soon it began to be changed. However, even as it was changed by men it continued to be a source of guidance for the Israelites and to some degree it is still effective for salvation (2:62, 5:69).<br />
<br />
The above examples show that revelation can serve its purpose to a reasonable degree even when it is altered by men. This is a point that is not understood, not only by some Muslims, but also by some Christian missionaries who often say how could the Muslims say that the Torah and Injil have suffered <i>tahrif</i> while at the same time say that the Torah and Injil contain light and can save people.<br />
<br />
In like manner the Hadith is based on divine revelation and even though it has been changed and corrupted by men, as we shall see in some detail in Part III of this book, yet it still contains light and is effective for human salvation. </span><b><span style="COLOR: black">(Dr. Ahmad Shafaat, <i>The Sacred Hadith Project, </i>Chapter 2: The Message and the Messenger,<i> </i><a href="http://www.islamicperspectives.com/HadithProject2.htm"><font color="#3333ff">Source</font></a>)</span></b></font></font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; </font></font></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Faced with the overwhelming arguments in favour of the authority of <i>sunnah</i>, some people resort to another way of suspecting its credibility, that is, to suspect its historical authenticity. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">According to them, the <i>sunnah</i> of the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> though having a binding authority for all times to come, has not been preserved in a trustworthy manner. Unlike the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n, they say, there is no single book containing reliable reports about the <i>sunnah</i>. There are too many works having a large number of traditions sometimes conflicting each other. And these books, too, were compiled in the third century of Hijrah. So, we cannot place our trust in the reports which have not even been reduced to writing<span style="mso-tab-count: 1"> </span>during the first three centuries. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">This argument is based on a number of misstatements and misconceptions. As we shall see in this chapter, <i>insh&acirc;-All&acirc;h</i>, it is totally wrong to claim that the traditions of the <i>sunnah</i> have been compiled in the third century. But, before approaching this historical aspect of the <i>sunnah</i>, let us examine the argument in its logical perspective. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This argument accepts that the Holy Prophet </font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">has a prophetic authority for all times to come, and that his obedience is mandatory for all Muslims of whatever age, but in the same breath it claims that the reports of the <i>sunnah</i> being unreliable, we cannot carry out this obedience. Does it not logically conclude that All&acirc;h has enjoined upon us to obey the Messenger, but did not make this obedience practicable. The question is whether All&acirc;h Almighty may give us a positive command to do something which is beyond our ability and means. The answer is certainly &quot;no.&quot; The Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n itself says, </font></font></span></p>

<p align="center" class="arabic" style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">All&acirc;h does not task anybody except to his ability. </font></font></span><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It cannot be envisaged that All&acirc;h will bind all the people with something which does not exist or cannot be ascertained. Accepting that All&acirc;h has enjoined upon us to follow the <i>sunnah</i> of the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">, it certainly implies that the <i>sunnah</i> is not undiscoverable. If All&acirc;h has made it obligatory to follow the <i>sunnah</i>, He has certainly preserved it for us, in a reliable form. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">In this verse, All&acirc;h Almighty has assured the preservation of the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n. This implies that the Qur&#39;&acirc;n will remain uninterpolated and that it shall always be transferred from one generation to the other in its real and original form, undistorted by any foreign element. The question now is whether this divine protection is restricted only to the words of the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n or does it extend to its real meanings as well. If the prophetic explanation is necessary to understand the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n correctly, as proved in the first chapter, then the preservation of the Qur&#39;&acirc;nic words alone cannot serve the purpose unless the prophetic explanations are also preserved. As quoted earlier, the Holy Book says, </font></font></span></p>

<p align="center" class="quote" style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">We have revealed to you the Zikr (Qur&#39;&acirc;n) so that you may explain to the people what has been sent down for them. </font></font></span><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Again, the words &quot;for the people&quot; indicate (especially in the original Arabic context), that the Holy Prophet&#39;s</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> explanation is always needed by &quot;everyone.&quot; </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Now, if everyone, in every age is in need of the prophetic explanation, without which they cannot fully benefit from the Holy Book, how would it be useful for them to preserve the Qur&#39;&acirc;nic text and leave its prophetic explanation at the mercy of distorters, extending to it no type of protection whatsoever. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, once the necessity of the prophetic explanations of the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n is accepted, it will be self-contradictory to claim that these explanations are unavailable today. It will amount to negating the divine wisdom, because it is in no way a wise policy to establish the necessity of the <i>sunnah</i> on the one hand and to make its discovery impossible on the other. Such a policy cannot be attributed to All&acirc;h, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">As for the <i>mutaw&acirc;tir</i>, nobody can question its authenticity. The fact narrated by a <i>mutaw&acirc;tir</i> chain is always accepted as an absolute truth even if pertaining to our daily life. Any statement based on a <i>mutaw&acirc;tir</i> narration must be accepted by everyone without any hesitation. I have never seen the city of Moscow, but the fact that Moscow is a large city and is the capital of U.S.S.R. is an absolute truth which cannot be denied. This fact is proved, to me, by a large number of narrators who have seen the city. This is a continuously narrated, or a <i>mutaw&acirc;tir</i>, fact which cannot be denied or questioned. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">I have not seen the events of the First and the Second World War. But the fact that these two wars occurred stands proved without a shadow of doubt on the basis of the <i>mutaw&acirc;tir</i> reports about them. Nobody with a sound sense can claim that all those who reported the occurrence of these two wars have colluded to coin a fallacious report and that no war took place at all. This strong belief in the factum of war is based on the <i>mutaw&acirc;tir</i> reports of the event. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In the same way the <i>mutaw&acirc;tir</i> reports about the <i>sunnah</i> of the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> are to be held as absolutely true without any iota of doubt in their authenticity. The authenticity of the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n being the same Book as that revealed to the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> is of the same nature. Thus, the <i>mutaw&acirc;tir</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i>, whether they be <i>mutaw&acirc;tir</i> in words or in meaning, are as authentic as the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n, and there is no difference between the two in as far as the reliability of their source of narration is concerned. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Although the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> falling under the first category of the <i>mutaw&acirc;tir</i>, <i>ie</i>. the <i>mutaw&acirc;tir</i> in words, are very few in number, yet the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> relating to the second kind, namely the <i>mutaw&acirc;tir</i> in meaning, are available in large numbers. Thus, a very sizeable portion of the <i>sunnah</i> of the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> falls in this kind of <i>mutaw&acirc;tir</i>, the authenticity of which cannot be doubted in any manner. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">As for the second kind, <i>ie.</i> the <i>mashhoor</i>, its standard of authenticity is lower than that of the <i>mutaw&acirc;tir</i>; yet, it is sufficient to provide satisfaction about the correctness of the narration because its narrators have been more than three trustworthy persons in every generation. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The third kind is <i>khabar-ul-w&acirc;hid</i>. The authenticity of this kind depends on the veracity of its narrators. If the narrator is trustworthy in all respects, the report given by him can be accepted, but if the single reporter is believed to be doubtful, the entire report subsequently remains doubtful. This principle is followed in every sphere of life. Why should it not be applied to the reports about the <i>sunnah</i> of the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">? Rather, in the case of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i>, this principle is most applicable, because the reporters of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> were fully cognizant of the delicate nature of what they narrate. It was not simple news of an ordinary event having no legal or religious effect. It was the narration of a fact which has a far-reaching effect on the lives of millions of people. The reporters of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> knew well that it is not a play to ascribe a word or act to the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">. Any deliberate error in this narration, or any negligence in this respect would lead them to the wrath of All&acirc;h and render them liable to be punished in hell. Every reporter of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> was aware of the following well-known <i>mutaw&acirc;tir</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i>: </font></font></span><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p>

<p align="center" class="quote" style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Whoever intentionally attributes a lie against me, should prepare his seat in the Fire. </font></font></span><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> had created such a strong sense of responsibility in the hearts of the narrators of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> that while reporting anything about the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> they often turned pale out of fear, lest some error should creep into their narration. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">This was the basic reason for which the responsible narrators of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> showed the maximum precaution in preserving and reporting a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i>. This standard of precaution cannot be found in any other reports of historical events. So, the principle that the veracity of a report depends on the nature of its reporter is far more validly applicable to the reports of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> than it is applicable to the general reports of ordinary nature. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Let us now examine the various ways adopted by the <i>ummah</i> to preserve the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> in their original form. </font></font></span><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">As we shall later see, the companions of the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> reduced a large number of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> in writing. Yet, writing was not the sole means of their preservation. There were many other ways. </font></font></span><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><b><span style="COLOR: red">1. Memorization </span></b></font></font></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">First of all, the companions of the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> used to learn <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> by heart. The Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> has said: </font></font></span><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p>

<p align="center" class="quote" style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">May All&acirc;h bestow vigor to a person who hears my saying and learns it by heart and then conveys it to others exactly as he hears it. </font></font></span><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The companions of the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> were eager to follow this <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> and used to devote considerable time for committing <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> to their memories. A large number of them left their homes and began to live in the Mosque of the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> so that they may hear the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> directly from the mouth of the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">. They spent all their time exclusively in securing the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> in their hearts. They are called <i>Ash&acirc;b as-Suffah</i>. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The Arabs had such strong memories that they would easily memorize hundreds of verses of their poetry. Nearly all of them knew by heart detailed pedigrees of not only themselves, but also of their horses and camels. Even their children had enough knowledge of the pedigrees of different tribes. Hamm&acirc;d is a famous narrator of Arab poetry. It is reported that he knew by heart one hundred long poems for each letter of the alphabet, meaning thereby that he knew three thousand and thirty-eight long poems [<i>al-A&#39;lam</i> by Zrikli 2:131]. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The Arabs were so proud of their memory power that they placed more of their confidence on it than on writing. Some poets deemed it a blemish to preserve their poetry in writing. They believed that writings on papers can be tampered with, while the memory cannot be distorted by anyone. If any poets have written some of their poems, they did not like to disclose this fact, because it would be indicative of a defect in their memory [See <i>al-Aghani</i> 61:611]. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The companions of the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> utilized this memory for preserving <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> which they deemed to be the only source of guidance after the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n. It is obvious that their enthusiasm towards the preservation of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> far exceeded their zeal for preserving their poetry and literature. They therefore used their memory in respect of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> with more vigor and more precaution. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Sayyidun&acirc; Ab&ucirc; Hurairah</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">, the famous companion of the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">, who has reported 5,374 <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i>, says: </font></font></span><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Sayyidun&acirc; Ab&ucirc; Hurairah,</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> after embracing Isl&acirc;m, devoted his life exclusively for learning the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i>. He has reported more <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> than any other companion of the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Once, Marw&acirc;n, the governor of Mad&icirc;nah, tried to test his memory. He invited him to his house where he asked him to narrate some <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i>. Marw&acirc;n simultaneously ordered his scribe, Abu Zu&#39;aizi&#39;ah, to sit behind a curtain and write the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> reported by Ab&ucirc; Hurairah</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">. The scribe noted the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i>. After a year, he invited Ab&ucirc; Hurairah again and requested him to repeat what he had narrated last year, and likewise ordered Abu Zu&#39;aizi&#39;ah to sit behind a curtain and compare the present words of Ab&ucirc; Hurairah</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> with the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> he had already written previously. Sayyidun&acirc;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ab&ucirc; Hurairah</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> began to repeat the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> while Abu Zu&#39;aizi&#39;ah compared them. He found that Ab&ucirc; Hurairah did not leave a single word, nor did he change any word from his earlier narrations [<i>al-Bid&acirc;yah wan-Nih&acirc;yah</i> and <i>Siyar al-A&#39;l&acirc;m</i> of Dhahabi]. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Numerous other examples of this type are available in the history of the science of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> which clearly show that the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> reporters have used their extraordinary memory power given to them by All&acirc;h Almighty for preserving the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">, as promised by Him in the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">As we shall later see, scholars of the science of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> developed the science of <i>Asm&acirc; ur-Rij&acirc;l</i> by which they have deduced reliable means to test the memory power of each narrator of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i>. They never accepted any <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> as reliable unless all of its narrators were proved to have high memory standards. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, &quot;memory power&quot; in the science of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> is not a vague term of general nature. It is a technical term having specified criteria to test the veracity of narrators. A great number of scholars of the sciences of <i>Asm&acirc; ur-Rij&acirc;l</i> and <i>Jarh wa Ta&#39;d&icirc;l</i> have devoted their lives to examine the reporters of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> on that criteria. Their task was to judge the memory power of each narrator and to record objective opinions about them. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Memories of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> reporters cannot be compared with the memory of a layman today who witnesses an event or hears some news and conveys it to others in a careless manner seldom paying attention to the correctness of his narration. The following points in this respect are worth mentioning: </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">1. The reporters of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> were fully cognizant of the great importance and the delicate nature of what they intended to report. They whole-heartedly believed that any misstatement or negligent reporting in this field would cause them to be condemned both in this world and in the Hereafter. This belief equipped them with a very strong sense of responsibility. It is evident that such a strong sense of responsibility makes a reporter more accurate in his reports. A newsman reporting an accident of a common nature in which common people are involved, can report its details with less accuracy. But if the accident involves the President or the Prime Minister of his country, he will certainly show more diligence, precaution and shall employ his best ability to report the incident as accurately as possible. The reporter is the same, but in the second case he is more accurate in his report than he was in the first case, because the nature of the incident has made him more responsible, hence more cautious. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It cannot be denied that the companions of the Holy Prophet,</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> their pupils, and other reliable narrators of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> believed with their heart and soul that the importance of a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> attributed to the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> exceeds the importance of any other report whatsoever. They believed that it is a source of Isl&acirc;mic law which will govern the Ummah for all times to come. They believed that any negligence in this respect will lead them to the severe punishment of hell. So, their sense of responsibility while reporting <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> was far higher than that of a newsman reporting an important incident about the head of his country. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">2. The interest of the reporter in the reported events and his ability to understand them correctly is another important factor which affects the accuracy of his report. If the reporter is indifferent or negligent about what he reports, little reliability can be placed on his memory or on any subsequent report based on it. But if the reporter is not only honest, serious, and intelligent but also interested and involved in the event, his report can easily be relied upon. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">If some proceedings are going on in a court of law, the reports of these proceedings can be of different kinds. One report was given by a layman from the audience who was incidentally present at the court. He had neither any interest in the proceedings nor had due knowledge and understanding of the legal issues involved. He gathered a sketchy picture of the proceedings and reported it to a third person. Such a report can neither be relied upon nor taken as an authentic version of the proceedings. This report may be full of errors because the reporter lacks the ability to understand the matter correctly and the responsible attitude to report it accurately. Such a reporter may not only err in his reporting, but may after some time also forget the proceedings altogether. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Suppose there are some newsmen also who have witnessed the proceedings for the purpose of reporting them in their newspapers. They have more knowledge and understanding than a layman of the first kind. Their report shall be more correct than that of the former. But despite their interest and intelligence, they are not fully aware of the technical and legal questions involved in the proceedings. Their report shall thus remain deficient in the legal aspect of the proceedings and cannot be relied upon to that extent because despite their good memory, they cannot grasp the legal issues completely. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">There were also lawyers who were directly involved in the proceedings. They participated in the debate at the bar. They have argued the case. They were fully aware of the delicate legal issues involved. They understood each and every sentence expressed by other lawyers and the judge. It is obvious that the report of the proceedings given by these lawyers shall be the most authentic one. Having full knowledge and understanding of the case they can neither forget nor err while reporting the substantial and material parts of the proceedings. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Suppose all the three categories had the same standard of memory power. Yet, the facts narrated by them have different levels of correctness. It shows that the interest of the reporter in the reported event and his understanding of the facts involved plays an important role in making his memory more effective and accurate. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The deep interest of the companions of the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> in his sayings and acts, rather even in his gestures, is beyond any doubt. Their understanding of what he said, and their close knowledge and observation of the background and the environment under which he spoke or acted cannot be questioned. Thus, all the basic factors which help mobilize one&#39;s memory were present in them. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">3. The standard of memory power required for the authenticity of a report is not, as mentioned earlier, a vague concept for which no specific criteria exist. The scholars of the Science of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> have laid down hard and fast rules to ascertain the memory standard of each reporter. Unless a reporter of a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> has specific standards of memory, his reports and not accepted as reliable. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">4. There is a big difference between memorizing a fact which incidentally came to the knowledge of someone who never cared to remember it any more, and the memorizing of a fact which is learnt by someone with eagerness, with an objective purpose to remember it and with a constant effort to keep it in memory. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">While I studied Arabic, my teacher told me many things which I do not remember today. But the vocabulary I learnt from my teacher is secured in my mind. The reason is obvious. I never cared to keep the former remembered, while I was very much eager to learn the latter by heart and to store it in my memory. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The companions of the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> did not listen to him incidentally nor were they careless in remembering what they heard. Instead, they daily spared specific times for learning the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> by heart. The example of Ab&ucirc; Hurairah has already been cited. He used to spare one third of every night in repeating the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> he learnt from the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, memorization was not a weaker source of preservation of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i>, as is sometimes presumed by those who have no proper knowledge of the science of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i>. Looked at in its true perspective, the memories of the reliable reporters of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> were no less reliable a source of preservation than compiling the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> in book form. </font></font></span><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The second source of preservation of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> was by mutual discussions held by the companions of the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">.

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> makes it clear that the disclosure of knowledge is an inherent obligation on each knowledgeable person, no matter whether he is asked about it or not. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">As the knowledge of the <i>sunnah</i> of the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> was the highest branch of knowledge in the eyes of his companions, they deemed it an indispensable obligation on their shoulders to convey to others what they knew of the <i>sunnah</i>. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Thus, it was the most favorite hobby of the companions of the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> whenever they sat together, instead of being involved in useless talks, to discuss his sayings and acts. Each of them would mention what he knew while the others would listen and try to learn it by heart. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">These frequent discussions have played an important role in the preservation of the <i>Sunnah</i>. It was by the virtue of these discussions that the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> known only by some individuals were conveyed to others, and the circle of narrators was gradually enlarged. Since these discussions were carried out at a time when the Holy Prophet (</font><sub><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><img alt="" height="20" src="file:///D:/Bassam/Islam/My%20Articles/Islam/Hadeeth%20Rejecters/Refuti28.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_i1094" width="18" /></font></sub><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">) was himself present among them, they had the full opportunity to confirm the veracity of what has been conveyed to them in this process, and some of them actually did so. The result was that the knowledge of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> acquired a wide range among the companions, which not only helped in spreading the knowledge of <i>Sunnah</i> but also provided a check on the mistakes of narrations, because if someone forgets some part of a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i>, the others were present to fill in the gap and to correct the error. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The third way of preservation of the <i>Sunnah</i> was to bring it into practice. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The knowledge of <i>Sunnah</i> was not merely a theoretical knowledge, nor were the teachings of the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> merely philosophical. They related to practical life. The Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> did not confine himself to giving lessons and sermons only, he also trained his companions practically. Whatever they learnt from the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> they spared no effort to bring it into actual practice. Each companion was so enthusiastic in practicing the <i>Sunnah</i> of the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> that he tried his best to imitate even his personal habits. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus the whole atmosphere was one of following the <i>Sunnah</i>. The <i>Sunnah</i> was not a verbal report only, it was a living practice, a widespread behavior and a current fashion demonstrating itself everywhere in the society, in all the affairs of their daily life. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">If a student of mathematics confines himself with remembering the formulas orally, he is likely to forget them after a lapse of time, but if he brings them in practice, ten times a day, he shall never forget them. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Likewise, the <i>Sunnah</i> was not an oral service carried out by the companions. They brought it into their daily practice. The <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Sunnah</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic"> was the center of gravity for all their activities. How could they forget the </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Sunnah</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic"> of the Holy Prophet</span></font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> around which they built the structure of their whole lives? </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, constant practice in accordance with the dictates of the <i>Sunnah</i> was another major factor which advanced the process of preserving the <i>Sunnah</i> and protected it from the foreign elements aiming at its distortion. </font></font></span><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><b><span style="COLOR: red">4. Writing </span></b></font></font></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The fourth way of preserving of <i>ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> was writing. Quite a large number of the companions of the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> reduced the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> to writing after hearing them from the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is true that in the beginning the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> had forbidden some of his companions from writing anything other than the verses of the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n. However, this prohibition was not because the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> had no authoritative value, but because the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> had in the same breath ordered them to narrate his <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> orally. The full text of the relevant <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> is as follows: </font></font></span><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p>

<p align="center" class="quote" style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Do not write (what you hear) from me, and whoever has written something (he heard) from me, he should erase it. <u>Narrate to others (what you hear) from me</u>; and whoever deliberately attributes a lie to me, he should prepare his seat in the Fire.&quot; [Sahih Muslim] </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The underlined phrase of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> clarifies that prohibition for writing <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> was not on account of negating its authority. The actual reason was that in the beginning of the revelation of the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n, the companions of the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> were not fully familiar with the Qur&#39;&acirc;nic style, nor was the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n compiled in a separate book form. In those days some companions began to write the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> along with the Qur&#39;&acirc;nic text. Some explanations of the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n given by the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> were written by some of them mixed with the Qur&#39;&acirc;nic verses without any distinction between the two. It was therefore feared that it would lead to confuse the Qur&#39;&acirc;nic text with the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i>. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It was in this background that the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> stopped this practice and ordered that anything written other than the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n should be rubbed or omitted. It should be kept in mind that in those days there was a great shortage of writing paper. Even the verses of the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n used to be written on pieces of leather, on planks of wood, on animal bones and sometimes on stones. It was much difficult to compile all those things in a book form, and if the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> were also written in the like manner it would be more difficult to distinguish between the writings of the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n and those of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i>. The lack of familiarity with the Qur&#39;&acirc;nic style would also help creating confusion. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">For these reasons the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> directed his companions to abstain from writing the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> and to confine their preservation to the first three ways which were equally reliable as discussed earlier. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">But all this was in the earlier period of his prophethood. When the companions became fully conversant of the style of the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n and writing paper became available, this transitory measure of precaution was taken back, because the danger of confusion between the Qur&#39;&acirc;n and the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> no longer existed. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">At this stage, the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> himself directed his companions to write down the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i>.

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The history of the compilation of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> after the companions is even more vast and detailed. Each companion who narrated the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> had a large number of pupils who compiled what they heard from him. The pupils of the companions are called &quot;<i>T&acirc;bi&#39;&icirc;n</i>.&quot; </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The compilations of the T&acirc;bi&#39;&icirc;n were generally not arranged subject wise, though some of them have arranged the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> under subjective headings. The first known book of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> which is so arranged is <i>Al-Abw&acirc;b</i> of Im&acirc;m Sha&#39;bi (19-103 A.H.). This book was divided into various chapters. Each chapter contained the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> relating to the same subject like <i>sal&acirc;h, zak&acirc;h</i>, etc. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">This proves that the first book of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> arranged in a regular manner appeared in the very first century. Another book was written by Hasan al-Basri (d.110) in which he compiled <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> containing any explanations or commentaries of the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n [<i>Tadr&icirc;b ar-R&acirc;wi</i>]. This was also a regular book written on a particular subject which appeared in the first century. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In the era of the T&acirc;bi&#39;&icirc;n the compilation of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> was undertaken officially by the famous <i>khal&icirc;fah</i>, &#39;Umar ibn &#39;Abdul-Az&icirc;z (99-101 A.H.). He issued an official order to all governors under his domain that they should gather the knowledgeable persons from among the companions of the Holy Prophet&nbsp;</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">and their pupils and write down the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> found with them [<i>Fath al-B&acirc;ri</i>]. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The result of this official decree was that several books of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> were prepared and spread all over the country. Ibn Shih&acirc;b az-Zuhri was one of the pioneers of the compilation of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> in this period. He has written a number of books. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">All these books and scripts written in this period were afterwards included in the larger books of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> written later on, as is usual in the evolution of every science. The separate entity of these books and scripts, being uncalled for, was not much attended to. Thus, the larger books written in the second and third centuries gradually took their place, and being more comprehensive, detailed, and sufficient, they were so widely spread and studied that the books of the T&acirc;bi&#39;&icirc;n no longer remained on the scene. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">However, some manuscripts of these books were preserved. Later books were compared and confirmed by such preserved manuscripts. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">One of the books written in the days of the T&acirc;bi&#39;&icirc;n was the script of Hammam ibn Munabbih, a pupil of Abu Hurairah, who prepared a book containing <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> he heard from Abu Hurairah.</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> This book is also known as &quot;<i>As-Sah&icirc;fah as-Sah&icirc;hah</i>.&quot; All the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> of this book were included in later compilations. The full text of it is also found in the <i>Musnad</i> of Im&acirc;m Ahmad. The original script of this book was thus not attended to and was lost for a considerable time. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">In 1373 A.H. (1954 C.E.), two manuscripts of this book were discovered in the libraries of Berlin and Damascus, and were published by Dr. Muhammad Hamidullah with a detailed introduction. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Dr. Muhammad Hamidullah edited these manuscripts which were written centuries ago. He has also compared their text with the one narrated in the <i>Musnad</i> of Im&acirc;m Ahmad. He could not find any material difference between the two texts. There are a few very minor differences of negligible words which always exist between two manuscripts of the same book. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">It proves that the books of the T&acirc;bi&#39;&icirc;n were included and were thus made part of the later books of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i>, with all necessary precautions by which they can safely be relied upon. </font></font></span><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">This list is by no means exhaustive. But a careful study of these books only which are available today in printed forms would clearly reveal that their style is much developed and they definitely do not seem to be the first books on their subject. Some of them are in more than ten volumes, and their arrangement shows that the compilation of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> in those days reached a developed stage. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">All these valuable efforts of compiling the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> belong to the first and second centuries. Hence, one can easily see how false is the assumption that the compilation of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> did not take place before the third century. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">What we have cited above is more than sufficient to prove that the compilation of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> had begun in the very days of the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> and has continued in each point of time thereafter. This process has, no doubt, passed through certain stages as is usual in every new science or branch of knowledge. But the assumption that the process did not begin before the third century cannot by substantiated on any ground whatsoever. </font></font></span><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body" mstheme=""><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Although the task of preserving the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> through all the four ways mentioned earlier, including compilations in written form has been performed with due diligence throughout the first four centuries of Islamic history, yet it does not mean that all the traditions narrated or compiled in this period have been held as true and reliable. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">In fact, in the same period in which the work of the compilation of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> was going on, a very systematic science of criticism was developed by the scholars of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> in which numerous tests were suggested to verify the correctness of a narration. All these tests were applied to each and every tradition or report before holding it reliable. The different branches of knowledge which have been introduced by the scholars of the science of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> has no parallel in the art of historical criticism throughout world history. It is not possible for us to herein present even a brief introduction of these different branches and the valuable works produced in this respect. It may be said without any fear of exaggeration that thousands of books have been written on these different branches of knowledge regarding the science of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i>. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">It will be pertinent, however, to give a brief example of the nature of the criticism of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> carried on by scholars and the different tests applied by them to ascertain the veracity of a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i>. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The traditions viewed from different angles have been classified into hundreds of kinds. Relative to their standards of authenticity, the traditions are ultimately classified into four major categories: </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) <i>Sah&icirc;h</i> (sound) </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) <i>Hasan</i> (good) </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) <i>Da&#39;&icirc;f</i> (weak) </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">(d) <i>Maud&ucirc;&#39;</i> (fabricated) </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Only the first two kinds are held to be reliable. Precepts of the Shari&#39;ah can be based on and inferred from only these two kinds. Hence, only the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> of these two categories are held to be the source of Islamic law. The other two kinds have little or no value especially in legal or doctrinal matters. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Before declaring a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> as <i>sah&icirc;h</i> or <i>hasan</i>, the following tests are applied: </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) Scrutiny of its narrators. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) Scrutiny of the constancy of the chain of narrators. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) Comparison of its chain and text with other available paths of narration in the same manner. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">(d) Examination of the chain and the text of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> in the light of other material available on the subject, and to ensure that there is no defect in the chain or in the text. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">We will try to give a brief explanation of these four tests as they are applied by the scholars of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> to scrutinize the veracity of a tradition. </font></font></span><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The first and foremost test of the correctness of a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> relates to the credibility of its narrators. This scrutiny is carried out on two scores: firstly, examination of the integrity and honesty of a narrator, and secondly, examination of his memory power. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">To carry out this scrutiny, a separate complete Science has been introduced which is called &#39;<i>Ilm-ur-Rij&acirc;l</i> (the knowledge of men). The scholars of this science devoted their lives for the thorough enquiry about each person who has reported a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i>. For this, they used to go to his place and enquire about him from his neighbors, pupils, and friends so that no scholar would be impressed by his personal relations with a narrator. &#39;Ali ibn al-Madini, the famous scholar of <i>Rij&acirc;l</i>, when asked about his father, first tried to avoid the question and replied, &quot;Ask some other scholar about him.&quot; But when the question was repeated with a request for his own opinion, he said: </font></font></span></p>

<p align="center" class="quote" style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">It is the matter of Faith, (I, therefore, reply) he is a weak narrator. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Waki&#39; ibn Jarr&acirc;h, the well-known Im&acirc;m of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i>, held his father as &quot;weak&quot; in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i>, and did not rely on his reports unless they are confirmed by some reliable narrator. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Im&acirc;m Abu D&acirc;w&ucirc;d, the author of one of the Six Books, has opined about his son &#39;Abdull&acirc;h (this is the same &#39;Abdull&acirc;h whose work, <i>Kit&acirc;b-ul-Masalif</i>, has been published by some orientalists), that he was &quot;a great liar.&quot; </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Zaid ibn Abi Unaisah has said about his brother Yahya, &quot;Do not accept the traditions of my brother Yahya, because he is reputed in lying.&quot; </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Similar opinions are recorded in the books of the &#39;<i>Ilm-ur-Rij&acirc;l</i>. Hundreds of books have been written on this subject. Here are only a few examples: </font></font></span></p>

It contains the life accounts of 12,455 narrators, arranged in alphabetical order. (This is the total of the members given in each volume separately. Sometimes, the same narrator has been mentioned in different places with different names. So, the actual number of the narrators may be less, but not less than 10,000.) </span></font></font></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">You can pick up any name from any chain of any <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> in any book from the Six Books. This name will certainly be found in the <i>Tah<u>dh</u>&icirc;b at-Tah<u>dh</u>&icirc;b</i> recorded in its place in alphabetical scheme. There you can find his dates of birth and death, the list of his teachers, the list of his pupils, important events of his life, and the opinions of the scholars about his credibility. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">There are several other books meant for the narrators of the Six Books exclusively, and after consulting them one can easily reach a definite conclusion about the veracity of a narrator. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">This book consists of seven volumes and embodies the introduction of 5,991 narrators. </font></font></span></p>

Thus, it contains the introduction of 1,732 narrators. </span></font></font></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">All these three books are written and compiled by the same person, namely, H&acirc;fiz Ibn Hajar.

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The last book of this table has introduced only those narrators who have been held as &quot;weak&quot; narrators. Similar books are written by Ibn Abi Hatim, D&acirc;raqutni, etc. On the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>contrary, there are books which deal with the reliable narrators only, like <i>Thiq&acirc;t</i> of Ibn Hibb&acirc;n in eleven volumes. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Anyhow, if a narrator is found to be dishonest, has very weak memory or he is unknown, no trust is placed on his narrations. A large number of traditions has been repudiated on this score alone. </font></font></span><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><b><span style="COLOR: red">2. Constancy of the chain of narrators </span></b></font></font></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is well-known that no report, in the science of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i>, is accepted unless it gives the full chain of narrators upto the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">. Each narrator from this chain is first scrutinized on the touch-stone of his credibility as discussed above. But even if all the narrators of a chain are found to be reliable, it is not enough to hold the tradition as authentic. It must be proved that the chain is constant and no narrator has been missed in between. If it is found that some narrator has been missed at any stage, the tradition is held to be unreliable. To ensure the constancy of the chain, it is necessary to know about each narrator whether it is possible for him historically to meet the person from whom he claims to hear the tradition. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">This scrutiny is indeed very difficult and delicate. But the scholars of the science of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> have undertaken this task in such an accurate manner that one cannot but wonder. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">While holding an enquiry about each narrator, the scholars, besides ascertaining his integrity and memory, would also survey his teachers and pupils. Thus, a detailed list of both his teachers and pupils is available in each detailed book of <i>Rij&acirc;l</i>. So, when deciding about the constancy of a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> the scholars do not only make themselves sure about the dates of birth and death of each narrator, but also examine the list of his teachers and pupils. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Not only this, they often try to fix the time-span in which a narrator had opportunities to meet a particular teacher and that in which he did actually hear <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> from him. On the basis of this information they derive certain important conclusions about the credibility of a narrator. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">For example, &#39;Abdull&acirc;h ibn Lahi&#39;ah is a well-known Egyptian narrator of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i>. It is established that his memory was weak and he used to narrate those traditions which he wrote. At a particular time, his house was burnt by fire and all his books were also burnt. After this occurrence he sometimes used to report <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> from his memory. Therefore, some scholars have decided that his narrations before the accident are reliable while those narrated after it are not worthy of trust. Now, the pupils who have heard <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ah&acirc;d&icirc;th</i> from him in the early period, their narrations may be accepted, while the reports of those who have heard from him in the later period cannot be relied upon. The scholars have scrutinized the list of his pupils and have specified the names of his early pupils, like &#39;Abdull&acirc;h ibn Wahb, etc. and have declared that all the rest should be treated as his later pupils, and no trust might be placed on their narrations. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">In short, the second type of scrutiny, which is very essential in the criticism of traditions, relates to the constancy and perpetuity of the chain of narrators. If it is found that a narrator has not heard the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> directly from the one to whom he is ascribing it, the tradition is said to be <i>Munqati&#39;</i> (broken) which cannot be treated as reliable. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><b><span style="COLOR: red">3. Comparison with other narrations</span></b><span style="COLOR: red">: The third test applied to a tradition relates to its comparison with what is narrated by other pupils of the same teacher. </span></font></font></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes a tradition is reported by several narrators. All these reports about the same saying or event are said to be the <i>turuq</i> (different paths) of that tradition. While scrutinizing a tradition, the scholars undertake a combined study of all its &quot;paths.&quot; If it is found that the majority of the reliable reporters narrate the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i> in a particular way, but one of them reports it in a version substantially different from that of the others, his report is held to be a <i>sh&acirc;dh</i> (rare) version. In such case, despite the reliability of the reporter, his version is not accepted as a <i>sah&icirc;h</i> (sound) one, and no trust is placed on it unless it is confirmed and supported by any internal or external evidence. </font></font></span><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><b><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4. General analysis of the tradition:</font></span></b><span style="COLOR: red"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> The last, and very important, scrutiny is accompanied by the general analysis of a tradition. In this scrutiny the tradition is analyzed in the light of other relevant material available on the subject. The tradition is examined from different angles: whether the reported saying or event is at all possible; whether the reported event conforms to the established historical events; whether its text can be held as truly attributed to the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">; whether the chain of narrators is genuine, etc. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">This is a very difficult and delicate scrutiny which cannot be undertaken successfully unless the scholar has full command over all the relevant subjects, occupies complete knowledge of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i>, and has a great skill in the science of criticism of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i>. </font></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">If, after this scrutiny, a strong doubt appears to a scholar about the authenticity of a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i>, he points out that there is a &quot;defect&quot; (&#39;<i>ilal</i>) in the chain or in the text of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had&icirc;th</i>, and a tradition having this kind of &#39;<i>illah</i> or defect is not held as <i>sah&icirc;h</i>. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">sah&icirc;h</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic"> (sound) <i>had&icirc;th</i> has been defined by the scholars as follows: </span></font></font></span></p>
