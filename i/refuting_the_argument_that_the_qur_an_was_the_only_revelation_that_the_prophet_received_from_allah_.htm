For instance, Allah said to Adam:<br />
<br />
O Adam, dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden (2:35),<br />
<br />
and their Lord called them:<br />
<br />
Did I not forbid you . . . (7:22).<br />
<br />
In the case of Noah:<br />
<br />
And it was inspired in Noah: No one of thy folk will believe save him who hath believed already (11:36); Load therein two of every kind (11:11); O Noah, he is not one of thy household (11:46).<br />
<br />
Allah states of Abraham:<br />
<br />
That is our argument, which we gave to Abraham against his folk (6:83); O Abraham, forsake this (11:26);<br />
<br />
Jacob said:<br />
<br />
I do indeed scent the presence of Joseph, and when he retrieved his eyesight, he said:<br />
<br />
Did I not say to you that I know from Allah that which you know not? (12:94 ff.).<br />
<br />
In the case of Joseph:<br />
<br />
We inspired in him: thou wilt tell them of this deed of theirs when they know not (12:15).<br />
<br />
Allah called to Moses in the valley of Tuwa:<br />
<br />
O Moses, verily I am thy Lord (20:12),<br />
<br />
and then:<br />
<br />
. . . hearken to what is inspired.<br />
<br />
Again:<br />
<br />
We inspired Moses saying: Take away my slaves by night (20:77).<br />
<br />
These are only some of the many instances which can be given, in all of which reference is made to revelations from Allah to the Prophets on which have nothing to do with the revelations of Books.&nbsp;</span><b><span style="COLOR: black"> (Shaykh Shahidullah Faridi, Fallacies of Anti Hadith Arguments, <a href="http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=1846&amp;CATE=120">Source</a>)</span></b></font></font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; </font></font></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It follows from the foregoing discussion that the revelation the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> received from All&acirc;h is of two different kinds: </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i) the revelation of the Qur&#39;&acirc;n, the Holy Book, named in the Islamic terminology as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">al-wahy al-matluww</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic"> (the recited revelation, <i>i.e.</i></span> the revelation which can be recited in the prayers). This kind of revelation is confined to the verses of the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n and is written verbally in its folds. </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(ii) the revelation received by the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> from time to time to let him know the pleasure of All&acirc;h in day-to-day affairs and the details of the principles laid down in the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n with their correct interpretation. This kind of revelation is called <i>al-wahy ghair al-matluww</i> (the unrecited revelation). This kind of revelation is not conveyed to the people verbally. It has been demonstrated through the sayings and acts of the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">. </font></span></p>

<p class="section"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><b><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'">The Second Kind of Revelation Proved by the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n</span></b><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"> </span></font></font></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This second kind of revelation is not contained in the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n, but the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n itself not only refers to it frequently but attributes its contents to All&acirc;h Almighty. Some verses of the Holy Book are reproduced below which clearly prove that the &quot;revelation&quot; is not confined to the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n, but there is another kind of &quot;<i>wahy</i>&quot; which does not form part of the &quot;Holy Book,&quot; yet it is the revelation from All&acirc;h Almighty: </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><b><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'">First Example:</span></i></b><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"> The Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n says: </span></font></font></p>

<p class="quote"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">And We did not appoint the Qiblah on which you were earlier, but that We might know the people who follow the Messenger as distinct from those who turn back on their heels. (2:143) </font></span><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp; </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In order to understand the verse, it is necessary to know the background in which it was revealed: </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In the early days of <i>Madani</i> life, after the Holy Prophet&#39;s migration to Madinah, the Muslims were ordered to direct their faces in prayers towards <i>Baytul-Maqdas</i> (Jerusalem) which had been appointed as <i>Qiblah</i> of the Muslims. Up to seventeen months, the Muslims had been observing the <i>Baytul-Maqdas</i> as their <i>Qiblah</i>. It was after seventeen months that the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n abrogated the earlier order and the Muslims were required to observe the Holy Mosque of Makkah as their <i>Qiblah</i> and turn their faces towards it while praying. The following verse was revealed to appoint the new <i>Qiblah</i>: </font></span></p>

<p class="quote"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">.So turn your face towards al-Masjid al-Haraam. (2:144) </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This new order was criticized by some disbelievers and they objected on it as to why the <i>Baytul-Maqdas</i> was appointed as <i>Qiblah</i> earlier. The above quoted verse (2:143) was revealed to answer this objection. The answer was that the appointment of the former <i>Qiblah</i> was in order to test the people whether or not they follow the Messenger. To quote the meaning of the verse again: </font></span></p>

<p class="quote"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">And We did not appoint the Qiblah on which you were earlier, but that We might know the people who follow the Messenger. (2:143) </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Here the appointment of the previous <i>Qiblah</i> has been attributed to All&acirc;h Almighty, which is a clear indication to the fact that the appointment of <i>Baytul-Maqdas</i> as <i>Qiblah</i> was done by the order of All&acirc;h Almighty Himself. But this order is nowhere in the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n, and there is no verse in the Holy Book which directs the turning of faces towards <i>Baytul-Maqdas</i>. This order was given to Muslims by the Holy Prophet (</font><span style="mso-text-raise: -4.0pt"><v:shape alt="" id="_x0000_i1031" style="WIDTH: 13.5pt; HEIGHT: 15pt" type="#_x0000_t75"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <v:imagedata o:href="http://ccminc.faithweb.com/iqra/articles/authsun/images/chap1.49.gif" src="Refuti1.gif"></v:imagedata></font></font></v:shape><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><img alt="" height="20" src="file:///D:/Bassam/Islam/My%20Articles/Islam/Hadeeth%20Rejecters/Refuti1.gif" u1:shapes="_x0000_i1025" width="18" /></font></span><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">) with no reference to any verse of the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n. Still, this order was mentioned by the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n in the above quoted verse as the order of All&acirc;h: The words, </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&quot;We did not appoint the <i>Qiblah</i>,&quot; instead of the words, </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&quot;The Holy Prophet did not.&quot; are too clear on this point to need more explanation. </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This statement of the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n, thus, evidently proves that the previous order given by the Holy Prophet </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">was based on a revelation which did not form part of the Book. And this is exactly the &quot;unrecited revelation.&quot; The verse of the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n (2:143) quoted above proves the following facts: </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a) The Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> used to receive some revelations which are not contained in the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n. </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b) These revelations were from All&acirc;h Almighty, so much so that the orders based on such revelations were attributed to All&acirc;h Almighty. </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(c) The orders based on such revelation were as binding on the believers as the orders of the first kind of revelations, <i>i.e.</i> the verse of the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n. </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(d) These orders were sometimes given so as to test whether or not the Muslims follow the Messenger irrespective of the question that his orders are contained in the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n or not. </font></span><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp; </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><b><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Second Example:</font></span></i></b><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> In the beginning, one of the rules followed by the Muslims in respect of the fasts of Ramadan was that even a short nap after <i>iftaar</i> (breaking of a fast) would nullify the permissibility of having sexual intercourse with one&#39;s wife. So, if someone would sleep for a short while after <i>iftaar</i> and wake up again, he would lose the opportunity of sleeping with his wife during the rest of the night, despite that the fast was over. This rule was prescribed by the Holy Prophet and was not contained in the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n. But some Muslims broke the rule by sleeping with their wives after having a post-<i>iftaar</i> nap. Referring to these events, the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n first admonishes those people who did not follow the rule. Then, by abrogating the same, allows the Muslims in future to sleep with their wives even when they had a nap after <i>iftaar</i>. In this context the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n says: </font></span><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></span><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></span></p>

<p class="quote"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is made lawful for you, in the nights of fasts, to have sex with your women. They are a cover for you, and you are a cover for them. All&acirc;h knew that you were betraying yourselves; so, He relented towards you and pardoned you. So, now you can have sexual intimacy with them, and seek what All&acirc;h has destined for you, and eat and drink until the white thread of the dawn becomes distinct from the black thread; then complete the fasts up to the night. (2:187) </font></span><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp; </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The following points with respect to this verse are worth consideration: </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a) The verse confirms that having sex during the nights of Ramadaan was not lawful before. </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b) The people who had sex during the nights of Ramadaan before this verse was revealed are admonished by describing their act as &quot;betraying themselves.&quot; </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(c) The words, &quot;so He relented towards you and pardoned you,&quot; indicate that their sexual act was a sin, because &quot;relenting&quot; and &quot;pardoning&quot; occur only after a person commits a sin. </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">All these points confirm the fact that the earlier prohibition of having sexual intercourse during the nights of Ramadaan was validly made by a competent authority, and the Muslims were bound to abide by it. </font></span></p>

It is due to the fact that the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> did not enforce this prohibition by his own will, it was rather based on a revelation of All&acirc;h Almighty which is not contained in the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n. </font></span></p>

These verses are as under: </span></font></font></p>

<p class="quote"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">All&acirc;h has certainly helped you at Badr while you were weak. So, fear All&acirc;h so that you may be grateful.

If you observe patience and fear All&acirc;h and they come to you in this their heat, your Lord shall aid you with five thousand angels having distinct marks?&#39; And All&acirc;h did not make it but a good news for you so that your hearts might be satisfied. And there is no help except from All&acirc;h, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. (3:123-126) </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The emphasized sentence of these verses attributes the good news of the aid of angels to All&acirc;h Almighty, meaning thereby that the good news of this aid was given by All&acirc;h Himself. But this good news given at the time of Badr is nowhere available in the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n. In other words, there is no verse in the Holy Book revealed during the battle of Badr which implies the good news of the aid of the angels. What is quoted above is only a reference of that news, made at the time of a later battle, and it is expressly mentioned in this verse that the good news was given by the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">.

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">To eradicate the <i>Jahili</i> concept of the adopted son, All&acirc;h Almighty ordered the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> that he should marry Zainab</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> after her having been divorced by his adopted son, Zaid ibn Haarithah</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">.

So, when Zaid finished with her, We made you marry her, so that there may remain no restriction on the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons when they have finished with them. And the order of All&acirc;h had to be done. (33:37) </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Here the words, &quot;you were hiding in your heart what All&acirc;h was to disclose,&quot; refer to the fact that All&acirc;h had informed the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> that he will marry Zainab </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">after she is divorced by Zaid</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">.

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">From this it follows that the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> had been foretold by All&acirc;h that Zainab was going to be divorced by her husband.

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The second sentence is more significant in the context, that is, &quot;We made you marry her.&quot; Here All&acirc;h Almighty declares that the marriage between the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> and Sayyidah Zainab </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">was contracted by an order of All&acirc;h.This order is nowhere mentioned in the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n.

<p class="body"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><b><i><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'">Eighth Example:</span></i></b><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"> The Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n has repeatedly ordered the Muslims to establish <i>salaah</i> (the prayer) and to be steadfast in it. In the following verse, after repeating the same order, the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n gives a special concession to the Muslims that, in the state of war, when they fear an attack from their enemy, they can perform the prayer in whatever way they can, either riding on horses or camels or walking on their feet. But after the danger of the enemy is over, they are ordered to perform the prayer in its normal way. This principle has been laid down in the following words:&nbsp;</span><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'">&nbsp;</span></font></font></p>

<p class="quote"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Take due care of all the prayers and the middle prayer; and stand before All&acirc;h in total devotion. But if you are in fear, then (pray) on foot or riding, but when you are in peace, then recite the name of All&acirc;h in the way He taught you. (2:238-239) </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A number of points are worth consideration in these verses: </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Firstly, the verse assumes that there are more than one prayers obligatory on the Muslims, but the exact number of the prayers has not been given, neither in this verse nor at any other place in the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n. That the number of obligatory prayers is five is only mentioned by the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">. The Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n, by saying &quot;Take due care of all the prayers,&quot; confirms what the Holy Prophet </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">prescribed for the Muslims. </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Secondly, the verse lays special emphasis on the &quot;Middle Prayer,&quot; but does not define it. The definition has been left to the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">. </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Thirdly, the most important sentence in relation to our subject is, &quot;<i>when you are in peace, then recite the name of All&acirc;h in the way He taught you</i>.&quot; It goes without saying that the &quot;recitation of the name of All&acirc;h&quot; means here &quot;to perform the prayer&quot; as the context does not permit any other meaning. </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Now, the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n directs the Muslims that in the state of peace they should perform the prayer in its normal way which has been taught to them by All&acirc;h. It is an express indication that the normal way of performing prayers has been taught to the Muslims by All&acirc;h Himself. But no such way has ever been mentioned in the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n. There is no verse in the Holy Book mentioning the detailed way of performing prayer. It is only the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> who educated the Muslims as to how they are to perform it. But the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n holds the teaching of the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> to be the teaching of All&acirc;h. </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It means that All&acirc;h has taught the way of prayer to the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> through some &quot;unrecited revelation&quot; not contained in the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n, and the Holy Prophet </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">taught it to the Muslims. Thus, the Muslims have been taught by All&acirc;h through the teaching of the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">. However, the teaching of the Holy Prophet is described in the holy verse as the teaching of All&acirc;h, because it was based on the &quot;unrecited revelation.&quot; </font></span><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp; </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><b><i><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ninth Example:</font></span></i></b><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> Certain hypocrites had not accompanied the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> in the expedition of Hudaibiyah. After that, when the Muslims resolved to proceed to the battle of Khayber, the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> declared that only the participants of Hudaibiyah shall be entitled to accompany him on this journey. The hypocrites who did not go to Hudaibiyah were now interested in their participation in the battle of Khaybar because according to their anticipation the Muslims were expected to gain from there sizeable spoils, which the hypocrites wanted to share. But the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">, inspite of their requests, did not allow them to participate in the battle. </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This event has been referred to in the following verse of the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n: </font></span></p>

Say, &quot;You shall not follow us; so All&acirc;h has said earlier.&quot; (48:15) </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The emphasized words indicate that there was a previous word of All&acirc;h barring the participation of the hypocrites in the battle of Khaybar, and confining the battle to the participants of Hudaibiyah. But no such word exists anywhere in the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n. It was only a prophetic order. Still, All&acirc;h Almighty describes it as His Own word. The reason is obvious. The Prophetic order was based on the order of All&acirc;h received by him through some &quot;unrecited revelation&quot; which is not found in the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n. Yet, it was a revelation, as certain as any word of All&acirc;h. </font></span><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp; </font></span></p>

It was a strenuous exercise for him, because he felt it was much too difficult to listen to the revelation, to understand it correctly, and to learn it by heart, all at the same time. All&acirc;h Almighty relieved him from this burden when He revealed the following verses of the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n: </font></span></p>

<p class="quote"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Move not your tongue with it in order to hasten it. It is on Us to gather it (in your heart) and to recite it. So, when We read it, follow its reading. Then it is on Us to explain it. (75:16-19) </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In the last sentence, All&acirc;h Almighty has promised the Holy Prophet</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> to explain the verses of the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n to him. It is evident that this explanation is something separate from the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n itself. It is not the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n. It is its explanation or its exegesis. Therefore, it should necessarily be in some other form, distinct from the words of the Holy Book. And this is exactly what is meant by the &quot;unrecited revelation.&quot; But the two kinds of revelation, though different in their form, are both revealed to the Holy Prophet; both are from All&acirc;h; and both are to be believed and obeyed by the Muslims. </font></span><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp; </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Then the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n proceeds to say: &quot;And (All&acirc;h) has taught you what you did not know.&quot; It means that All&acirc;h has not only revealed the Book, but has also revealed the Wisdom, and also taught the Holy Prophet&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> what he did not know before.

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">These verses are quite explicit on the point that the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n has been revealed through an angel, named in the first verse as <i>Jibreel</i>, and in the second one as the Faithful Spirit; but the verse (42:51) quoted above describes that there are two more ways of revelation. These two modes have also been used in the case of the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3">. It means that the revelation sent down to the Holy Prophet was not confined to the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n, but there were other revelations, too. These revelations are termed as &quot;unrecited revelation.&quot; </font></font></span><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp; </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">These are sixteen verses, which affirm not only the existence of the &quot;unrecited revelation&quot; but also its reliability and authenticity, and its binding nature. It is not intended here to produce all the material available in the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n to establish this kind of revelation. The purpose was to give some examples only, which has, perhaps, been substantially served. But before proceeding further, it will be useful to recollect and summarize the conclusions that stand proved in the light of the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n as discussed above: </font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">(1) The function of the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"> like other prophets is not only to convey the divine Book. He is also to teach the Book, to teach the wisdom and to make people pure by training them practically. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">(2) The &quot;Obedience of the Holy Prophet&quot;</font><font size="3"> is as necessary as the obedience of All&acirc;h; because the latter has always been mentioned in the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n combined with the former. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">(3) The obedience of the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"> in practical is the obedience of All&acirc;h; and the latter cannot be carried out except through the former. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">(4) The Muslims are bound not only to obey the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3">, but they are also under an obligation to follow him. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">(5) Whatever the Holy Prophet</font><font size="3"> says or does in his capacity of a Messenger is always based on, or confirmed by, a revelation from All&acirc;h. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="body"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'">(6) This revelation is sometimes contained in the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n and called the recited revelation, and sometimes it is sent down in addition to the Holy Qur&#39;&acirc;n, and the same is termed as &quot;unrecited revelation.&quot; </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Book Antiqua"><font color="#000000"><b>(Taqi Usmani, <i>The Authority of Sunnah</i>, Chapter 1: <i>Sunnah</i>: The Second Source of Islamic Law, <a href="http://ccminc.faithweb.com/iqra/articles/authsun/chap1.html"><font color="#3333ff">Source</font></a>)</b></font></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Book Antiqua'"> </span></font></font></p>
