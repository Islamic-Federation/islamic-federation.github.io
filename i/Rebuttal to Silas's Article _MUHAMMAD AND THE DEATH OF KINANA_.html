<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Many anti Islamics have used this incident of the torture of Kinana to attack the integrity of the Prophet. When I first read about it, I myself was quite shocked that the Prophet would torture some one just because of some treasure.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Indeed Islam teaches us that treatment of the prisoners of war is a must. For the evidence you can read...</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Now back to the Kinana issue. Actually the source of this story is invalid. Not because the source is weak, but because there is no source!</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">Having left Medina and settled at Khaibar, the Banu Nadir started hatching a wide-spread conspiracy against Islam. Their leaders, Sallam Ibn Abi-al Huqauaiq, Huyayy Ibn Akhtab, Kinana al-Rabi and others came to Mecca, met the Quraish and told them that Islam could be destroyed."</font> <font color="#000000"><b>(Allama Shibli Nu'Mani, <i>Sirat-Un-Nabi</i>, volume II, p 106)</b></font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">This goes to show that Kinana was a war criminal. Let's read on...</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#ff0000" size="3">" While describing the battle of Khaibar, the history writers have committed a serious blunder in reporting a totally baseless report, which has become a common place. It is said that the Prophet ( Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had granted amnesty to the Jews on condition that they would not hide anything. When Kinana Ibn Rabi' refused to give any clue to the hidden treasures, the Prophet ( peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ordered Zubair to adopt stern measures to force a disclosure. Zubair branded his chest with a hot flint again and again, till he was on the point of death. At last he ordered Kinana to be put to death and all the Jews were made slaves.</font></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#ff0000" size="3">The whole truth in the story is that Kinana was put to death. But it was not for his refusal to give a clue to the hidden treasure. He was put to death because he had killed Mahmud Ibn Maslama (also Muslima). Tabari had reported it in unambiguous words: " Then the Holy Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave Kinana to Muhammad Ibn Maslama (Muslima), " and he put him to death in retaliation of the murder of his own brother, Mahmud Ibn Maslama (Muslima)."</font></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><u><b><font face="Times New Roman" color="#ff0000" size="3">In the rest of the report, both Tabari and Ibn Hisham have quoted it from Ibn Ishaq, but Ibn Ishaq does not name any narrator. Traditionalists, in books on Rijal, have explicitly stated that Ibn Ishaq used to borrow from the Jews stories concerning the battle of the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). As Ibn Ishaq does not mention the name of any narrator whatsoever in this case, there is every likelihood of the story of having been passed on by the Jews.</font></b></u></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#ff0000" size="3">That a man should be tortured with burns on his chest by the sparks of a flint is too heinous a deed for a Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who had earned for himself the title of Rahma'lil Alamin (Mercy for all the worlds). After all, did he not let the woman who had sought to poison him go scot free? Who would expect such a soul to order human body to be so burnt for the sake of a few coins.</font></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">As a matter of fact, Kinana Ibn Rabi Ibn al-Huquaiq had been granted his life on the condition that he would never break faith or make false statements. He had also given his word, according to one of the reports, that if he did anything to the contrary, he could be put to death. Kinana played false, and the immunity granted to him was withdrawn. He killed Mahmud Ibn Maslama (Muslima) and had, therefore to suffer for it, as we have already stated on the authority of Tabari."</font> <font color="#800080"><b><font color="#000000">(Allama Shibli Nu'Mani, <i>Sirat-Un-Nabi, </i>volume II, p </font></b></font><b><font color="#000000">173-174)</font></b></font></font></p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</i></div>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">As we can see there is no evidence what so ever for this story of Kinana because there is no narration or source given. It was contrary to the teachings of the Quran and the Prophet's character. Therefore, Christians have to stop using this argument against the glorious Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).</font></p>

<p class="w-body-text-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">A man named Ta'ima stole a suit of armor from Qataada, his neighbor. &nbsp;Qataada had hidden the armor inside a sack of flour so, when Ta'ima took it, the flour leaked out of the sack through a hole, leaving a trail up to his house. &nbsp;Ta'ima then left the armor in the care of a Jewish man named Zayed, who kept it in his house, in order to conceal his crime.&nbsp; Thus, when the people searched for the stolen armor, they followed the trail of flour to Ta'ima's house but did not find it there. &nbsp;When confronted, he swore to them he had not taken it and knew nothing about it. &nbsp;The people helping the owner also swore that they had seen him breaking into Qataada's house at night, and had subsequently followed the tell-tale trail of flour, which had led them to his house. &nbsp;Nevertheless, after hearing Ta'ima swearing he was innocent, they left him alone and looked for further clues, finally finding a thinner trail of flour leading to the house of Zayed, and so arrested him.</p>
<p class="w-body-text-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 8pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The Jewish man told them that Ta'ima had left the armor with him, and some Jewish people confirmed his statement. &nbsp;The tribe to which Ta'ima belonged sent some of their men to the Messenger of God to present his side of the story, and asked them to defend him. &nbsp;The delegation was told, 'If you do not defend our clansman, Ta'ima, he will lose his reputation and be punished severely, and the Jew will go free.' &nbsp;The Prophet was subsequently inclined to believe them, and was about to punish the Jewish man when God revealed the following verses of the Quran to vindicate the Jew.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Shamoun then brings up the issue of the Jewess who poisoned the Prophet's sheep. He argues that the narrations seem to be contradicting each other on whether the Prophet (peace be upon him) had her killed or not. There is no contradiction. What happened was that once the Prophet (peace be upon him) found out she put the poison, he forgave her. However, what happened was that later on after some time the poison ended up killing the Prophet's companion. When that occurred the Prophet (peace be upon him) had her killed for murder in retaliation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Shamoun has a problem with this reconciliation and says:</p>

    <li class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; COLOR: black; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><i>Yet by forgiving her without demanding retribution would mean that Muhammad failed to maintain the balance between justice and mercy, righteousness and compassion. </i></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">We agree with the first and third points above, but not the second.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">First of all, Muhammad (peace be upon him) had no right<strong> to demand</strong> the family of Bishr to forgive the Jewess. It is exclusively their right and their decision. Muhammad (peace be upon him) had no authority to intervene and overrule God's law at this point.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Secondly, Shamoun thinks that if Muhammad (peace be upon him) were to punish people for their crimes then that would negate the notion that he was sent as a mercy to people. To always forgive people for heinous crimes for no valid reason is not mercy, rather it is stupidity and injustice. The Prophet (peace be upon him) forgave at times and implemented justice at times. He knew when to balance between the two. He couldn't always be forgiving, for this would put the Muslims in a weak position and make them vulnerable to more attacks by their enemies. Neither did he always punish people as is evident by him forgiving the Bedouin that tried to kill him (Saheeh Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 49, Number 458), forgave the one who murdered his uncle (Saheeh Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 59, Number 399), the people of Mecca when he conquered them (Saheeh Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 3, Number 112), except with very few exceptions, etc.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Indeed Islam is the religion of moderation. We don't need blood thirsty murderers as we see the false God of the Old Testament ordering people to be and we don't need cowards who would just turn the other cheek as we see the false God of the New Testament trying to teach people to do. Rather, we need Islam that is moderate and balances between justice and mercy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Shamoun dared to say:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><i>Sidenote: This assumes that the Jewess was wrong for what she did to Muhammad and deserved to be punished, when the reality is that she was simply seeking just retribution against a tyrant who harassed and murdered her family and people.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">How dare he utter the above words? If Christianity doesn't agree with Shamoun's statement above, then Shamoun should reconsider what he said. If Christianity does agree then this goes to show that Shamoun's religion is one that orders people to act like they are peaceful and loving people that obey their authorities despite them oppressing them (assuming Muhammad oppressed the Jews), but deep down inside Christians bare hatred for people and would resort to violence and anarchy. We will let Shamoun tell us what Christianity teaches on this issue.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The Jewess did not say that she poisoned the Prophet (peace be upon him) because he oppressed her. She said that she did it in order to test his Prophethood.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Secondly, we challenge Shamoun to show us a single instance where the Prophet (peace be upon him) fought the Jews unless they were planning to kill him first. If he killed his enemies first, does that mean that he is to be blamed? What is this reasoning? Just because the Jewess said that the Prophet (peace be upon him) had her father killed, is that evidence that he was killed unjustly? Well of course not. We challenge Shamoun to show us the injustice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="COLOR: black">I think Shamoun was rushing when he was typing the above. Because if Shamoun is somehow trying to argue that if there is a man who is trying to know something and hasn't received revelation from God regarding the knowledge of that thing, thus this proves that this man is not a prophet, then this would be disastrous for Shamoun. There is no point for us to pick out examples from the Bible where Prophets wanted to know certain things, but God didn't inform them. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="COLOR: black">Our simple response is this: </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="COLOR: black">Allah didn't need to reveal this knowledge to the Prophet (peace be upon him) by revelation because Allah already knew that the Prophet (peace be upon him) would find out where the treasure was eventually. Furthermore, Allah predestined that Kinana's fate was to be the way it was for his crimes and there is no reason to believe why Allah would have wanted it any other way.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="COLOR: black">Secondly, even if the Prophet (peace be upon him) did receive revelation regarding where the treasure was Kinana would still have been killed for withholding the information (because the Prophet would then have found out where the treasure was by revelation, not from Kinana) and breaking the peace treaty.</span></p>

</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="COLOR: black">Ha! Why can't the God of Christianity and Islam do that for <b>ALL PEOPLE then? </b>Well, it is because we believe in free will of the human being. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="COLOR: black">Plus, what is so special about Kinana? It was his greed that made him hide the treasure from the Prophet (peace be upon him). All he had to do was not be greedy and stick to the peace treaty and he would have been okay. But he didn't. But again, in the eyes of the missionaries such as Shamoun it has to be Muhammad's (peace be upon him) fault. They hate the fact that they know that it was Kinana's fault, but their hatred for Islam won't allow for them to admit it and they have to find a way to put the blame on the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Allah probably thought that Kinana deserved what he got for breaking the treaty and being a liar and for committing murder. So Allah didn't want Kinana to be guided. Allah did choose "the better thing" by allowing this war criminal to be killed in order to make an example of him to the others to not mess with the Muslims and to strengthen their image. This eventually led to the protection of the Muslim people because it hindered people from&nbsp;intimidating&nbsp;them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Again, there is nothing special about Kinana. If we say that Allah should have intervened for Kinana's sake, then <b>why not for everyone else? </b>Why doesn't Shamoun's God guide me - Bassam Zawadi - by providing me with supernatural insight and convince me of the truth of Christianity, besides continue to make it clear to me that Christianity is a false religion because the Bible contains glaring day light mistakes and we aren't absolutely sure of who wrote the majority of the Bible? Why does Shamoun's God continue to deceive me into making me think that Islam is the pure monotheistic faith that appeals to one's natural disposition and making it appear to me that the Trinity teaches nothing but polytheism? <b>WHY? WHY? WHY? When do all these questions end? What is the point of asking these questions? They prove nothing.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Even if we are willing to grant that Kinana was tortured before he was killed, this still does nothing to disprove Muhammad's (peace be upon him) prophethood.
